This week we‚Äôre excited to release a massive overhaul to our search capabilities, making it easier than ever to find what you need. We‚Äôve also launched a powerful new Tag Management system and completely rebuilt our reporting engine for enhanced flexibility and reliability.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **A Brand New Way to Tag and Organize:** We've launched a comprehensive Tag Management system! You can now create, update, and delete tags via a new set of API endpoints. This makes it easier than ever to categorize your resources. You can also find all resources that share a specific tag and value (e.g., all sites with `Region:Europe`).
*   **Dynamic, Tag-Based Reporting:** Reporting is now more flexible and powerful. You can create report schedules that automatically include sites based on their tags. For example, create a single report that always includes all sites tagged with `Priority:High`.
*   **Group and Aggregate Data in Reports:** Take your reports to the next level by automatically grouping sites based on a shared tag. You can also see aggregated uptime metrics (average, min, or max) for each group, giving you a clear overview of performance by region, customer, or any other category.
*   **New Service Level Agreement (SLA) Reports:** Generate detailed, multi-page SLA reports that include uptime/downtime stats, performance summaries, and incident logs. You can even calculate availability based on your specific business hours.
*   **RADIUS Request Logging:** For deeper insights and easier troubleshooting, you can now retrieve authentication and authorization event logs for your Network Access Servers (NAS) and users via the API.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Massive Search Overhaul:** Finding what you need is now faster and easier than ever!
    *   **Search Everything:** We've made a huge number of items searchable from the global search bar, including: Sites (by name, address, IP, model, etc.), Policies, WAN Tunnels, VPN Instances, Notification Groups, Captive Portals, Workflows, and all types of Schedules.
    *   **Smarter Search Engine:** Our upgraded search engine is more tolerant of typos, provides a relevance score to show you the best matches, and allows for advanced filtering by date range and type.
    *   **Search Within Metadata:** You can now perform targeted searches for content within an item's metadata fields.
*   **Faster, More Reliable Reporting:** We've rebuilt our report generation system from the ground up.
    *   Reports are now scheduled and generated through a new, highly reliable system to ensure they always arrive on time.
    *   PDF generation is significantly faster, especially for large reports.
    *   Generated reports now feature a short, human-readable ID in the header for easy reference.
*   **Improved Tagging Experience:**
    *   Enjoy much faster performance when retrieving resource metadata.
    *   The system is now smarter about handling case variations (e.g., "new york" and "New York" are treated as the same value), preventing duplicate tags.
*   **Increased System Reliability and Security:**
    *   We've improved the reliability of site status notifications (Online, Offline, Rebooted) and WAN tunnel status monitoring to prevent duplicate alerts.
    *   Workflows that use external APIs are now more resilient, with the ability to automatically refresh authentication and retry failed calls.
    *   We've rolled out numerous under-the-hood security enhancements, including encrypting connections between our internal services to better protect your data.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   **Reporting:** Corrected an issue where a site with multiple tags could be incorrectly included in more than one group within the same report, ensuring accurate data aggregation.
*   **Search:** Fixed bugs where hardware details or scheduled scripts could be incorrectly indexed, leading to more accurate search results. Our data ingestion process is also more resilient to incomplete data.
*   **System Stability:** Resolved an issue with our internal caching system to improve the reliability of simultaneous operations. We also fixed a bug in the Network Access Server (NAS) deletion process to ensure it completes successfully.
