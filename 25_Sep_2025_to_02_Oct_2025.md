This week delivers a transformative search experience, comprehensive tag management capabilities, and a completely rebuilt SLA reporting engine. These enhancements make it dramatically easier to find resources, organize your MikroTik fleet, and track network performance at scale.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Comprehensive Tag Management API:** Launched a complete API-driven tag management system enabling programmatic creation, updates, and deletion of metadata tags. This powerful capability streamlines resource categorization across your MikroTik fleet and supports dynamic organization strategies. Query all resources sharing specific tag key-value pairs (e.g., all sites with `Region:Europe`) to build custom fleet management tools and automated workflows.
- **Dynamic Tag-Based SLA Reporting:** Create intelligent SLA report schedules that automatically include sites based on tag-matching criteria. For example, maintain a single report definition that always includes all sites tagged `Priority:High`—new sites matching the criteria are automatically incorporated without manual updates. Perfect for MSPs managing multiple customer networks or enterprises with dynamic infrastructure.
- **Site Grouping & Aggregated Metrics:** Elevate SLA reporting with automatic site grouping based on shared tags. View aggregated uptime metrics (average, minimum, or maximum) for each logical group, providing clear performance overviews by region, customer, or any custom organizational dimension.
- **Multi-Page PDF SLA Reports:** Generate detailed, professional SLA reports including uptime/downtime statistics, performance summaries against targets, and comprehensive incident logs. Calculate availability based on your specific business hours for accurate SLA tracking that reflects actual operational impact.
- **RADIUS Authentication Logging:** Access detailed authentication and authorization event logs for RADIUS Network Access Servers and user accounts through the API. Essential for troubleshooting Captive Portal issues, security investigations, and compliance auditing.

### ✨ Enhancements

**Transformative Search Experience**

- **Universal Search Coverage:** Dramatically expanded searchable resources from the global search interface, now including Sites (by name, address, IP, MikroTik model), Policies (all types), Managed VPN instances, Notification Groups, Captive Portals, Workflow definitions, and all Schedule types (SLA reports, vulnerability scans, scripts).
- **Intelligent Search Engine:** Upgraded search algorithms now tolerate typos, provide relevance scoring to surface best matches first, and support advanced filtering by date ranges and resource types for precision discovery.
- **Metadata Search:** Perform targeted searches within metadata field content, enabling you to find sites or resources based on custom tag values and organizational attributes.

**Rebuilt SLA Reporting Infrastructure**

- **Highly Reliable Scheduling:** Report generation now operates through a completely redesigned, cloud-native scheduling system ensuring consistent, on-time delivery even as your network scales.
- **Accelerated PDF Generation:** Significantly faster report rendering, especially for large SLA reports covering dozens of sites with extensive incident histories.
- **Human-Readable Report IDs:** Generated reports feature short, memorable identifiers in headers for easy reference in communications and support tickets.

**Enhanced Tag Management**

- **Faster Metadata Retrieval:** Substantially improved performance when fetching resource metadata and tags across large fleets.
- **Smart Case Handling:** The system automatically normalizes case variations (e.g., "new york" vs "New York"), preventing accidental duplicate tags and ensuring consistent tag-based automation.

**Increased Operational Reliability**

- **Improved Fault Detection:** Enhanced reliability of site status notifications (Online, Offline, Rebooted) and WAN tunnel monitoring to eliminate duplicate alerts caused by transient network conditions.
- **Resilient External Integrations:** Workflows using external API integrations (Slack, Microsoft Teams, custom webhooks) now automatically refresh authentication tokens and implement intelligent retry logic for failed operations.
- **Enhanced Security Posture:** Deployed comprehensive internal security hardening including encrypted service-to-service communications and strengthened data isolation across multi-tenant boundaries.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **SLA Report Accuracy:** Corrected a logic error where sites with multiple matching tags could be incorrectly duplicated across groups within a single report, ensuring accurate data aggregation and site counts.
- **Search Index Quality:** Fixed indexing bugs affecting MikroTik hardware details and scheduled script metadata, improving search result accuracy. Enhanced data ingestion resilience to gracefully handle incomplete or malformed data.
- **System Stability:** Resolved a caching system issue that could cause race conditions during simultaneous resource operations. Fixed a bug in RADIUS Network Access Server deletion that could prevent proper cleanup completion.
