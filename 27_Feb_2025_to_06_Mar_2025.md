This week, we've rolled out several updates across our services, bringing new capabilities, general improvements, and important fixes.

### New Features

*   **Enhanced Network Visibility and Control:** New features empower administrators and developers with more granular control and visibility. You can now retrieve and filter active user session data programmatically via a new API, offering flexibility for integration and reporting.
*   **Admin Panel User Management & Metrics:** Administrators gain enhanced user session monitoring and management directly within the admin panel, alongside new dashboard metrics for system usage insights (total sites, instances, active sessions, coupon redemptions).
*   **Flexible Vulnerability Scanning:** New options are available for vulnerability scanning, including the ability to look up historical vulnerabilities associated with a specific network device (MAC address) across past scan results, and trigger on-demand scans for individual or multiple IP addresses within a site, providing more targeted assessment capabilities.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Configuration Validation:** We've made enhancements to configuration validation processes to provide more precise feedback and help prevent errors during setup.
*   **Reliable Redirections and Network Access:** Updates include improvements to network checks and authentication redirects, ensuring smoother user journeys, as well as potential performance improvements for accessing allowed domains before authentication.
*   **Streamlined Admin Panel Navigation:** The admin panel navigation menu has been reorganized for better usability and easier access to different resources.
*   **Minor UI Updates:** Small visual updates, such as updated copyright information and integration of new branding assets, have been made to the portal interface.

### Bug Fixes

*   We've resolved several issues this week, including:
    *   Fixing an issue that sometimes prevented the removal of the last site assigned to a service instance via the API.
    *   Correcting a validation issue that previously forced an instance to be associated with a site immediately upon creation via the API.
    *   Ensuring accurate network data inventory by correctly removing associated records when a site tunnel is decommissioned.
    *   Improving the reliability when starting targeted scans for specific IP addresses.
    *   Fixing an issue with incorrect links provided in vulnerability scan completion email notifications.
