This week empowers administrators with better session visibility, introduces flexible vulnerability scanning options, and delivers critical Captive Portal configuration fixes.

### 🎉 New Features

- **User Session API**: Programmatically retrieve and filter active Captive Portal user sessions—enables custom reporting, integration with billing systems, and automated session management workflows. Essential for hotels, venues, and MSPs needing detailed guest access analytics.
- **Enhanced Admin Panel Monitoring**:
  - Real-time user session monitoring and management
  - System dashboard metrics: total sites, service instances, active sessions, coupon redemptions
  - Critical for operational visibility and capacity planning
- **Flexible Vulnerability Scanning**:
  - **Historical Device Vulnerability Lookup**: Query past vulnerability findings by MAC address across historical scans—track remediation progress and security posture trends
  - **On-Demand Targeted Scans**: Trigger vulnerability scans for individual IPs or multiple addresses within a site—enables rapid assessment of newly deployed devices without full network scans

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Improved Configuration Validation**: Enhanced validation provides more precise feedback during Captive Portal and Managed VPN setup—prevents configuration errors.
- **Reliable Authentication Flow**: Improved network checks and authentication redirects ensure smoother guest portal access. Potential performance improvements for allowlist domain access before authentication.
- **Streamlined Admin Navigation**: Reorganized admin panel menu improves usability and resource access.
- **Updated Branding**: Minor UI updates including copyright information and new branding assets.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Fixed inability to remove final site from Captive Portal instance via API
- Corrected validation forcing immediate site association during instance creation via API
- Ensured proper ARP data cleanup when Managed VPN tunnels are decommissioned
- Improved reliability for targeted IP address vulnerability scans
- Fixed incorrect links in vulnerability scan completion email notifications
