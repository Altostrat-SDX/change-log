We're excited to bring you a host of new features, significant improvements, and key bug fixes this week to enhance your experience.

### New Features

*   **Self-Service Subscription Management:** Gain greater control with new capabilities that allow creating new subscriptions, changing license quantities, and cancelling subscriptions directly via API.
*   **Billing Previews:** Plan ahead with new APIs to generate price quotes for potential new subscriptions and preview the details of your next invoice, including the impact of any recent changes.
*   **Secure Payment Method Initiation:** Easily begin the process for securely adding new payment methods through the API.
*   **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** Introduced a new API endpoint allowing authorized users to retrieve a log of key actions within their organization, providing valuable insights into activity.

### Improvements

*   **Enhanced Audit Log Usability:** The new Audit Log API now features sorting (most recent first), improved filtering options (view logs for all users), and pagination for better handling of large datasets.
*   **Richer User Data:** The user information endpoint now provides more contextual data, including the user's ID and the name of the team they belong to.
*   **Improved Profile Updates:** Users who authenticated using social connections can now successfully update their Name and Mobile phone number via the profile update endpoint.
*   **Authentication Flow Enhancement:** Added support for directing users directly to the signup flow from external applications via the login redirect endpoint.
*   **Detailed Subscription Information:** The Organization Summary API now provides more comprehensive details about each subscription, such as the associated plan, billing cycle, and any internal notes.
*   **Subscription Management Controls:** Enhanced validation to prevent reducing subscription quantity below current usage levels and ensure changes are only applied to subscriptions in a valid status.
*   **Improved Data Synchronization:** Strengthened the synchronization of user and organization data with integrated services.
*   **Internal Subscription Notes:** Added the ability to include internal notes on subscriptions via API.

### Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue where the mobile verification status was not accurately updated after a user changed their mobile number via the profile update endpoint.
*   Corrected issues related to the visibility and management of specific internal system roles, ensuring they are not exposed or assignable through standard user role APIs.
*   Fixed the required permission scope for accessing the new Audit Log API.
*   Improved the reliability of adding existing users to teams and assigning their initial roles via API endpoints.
*   Resolved an issue causing unnecessary duplication in internal processing of user and organization updates.

We are continuously working to improve the platform and appreciate your feedback!
