### Weekly Update (November 21 - November 28, 2024)

This week, our development efforts were concentrated on maturing the CVE scanning and SLA reporting services that were recently brought online. We're focused on building out their core functionalities to provide valuable insights.

**Service Enhancements & Feature Rollout:**

*   **CVE Scanning (`cve-scans`, `cve-scans-etl`):**
    *   Full report generation lifecycle for `cve-scans` is now active. Scans initiated by `cve-scans` now have their results fully processed by `cve-scans-etl`, leading to the generation and storage of comprehensive CVE reports (JSON/PDF) in S3.
    *   Integration with `ai-llm` for initial AI-assisted analysis (e.g., mitigation suggestions) is being established within the `cve-scans` service.
    *   Billing checks with the `auth` service for scan operations are now being integrated.
*   **SLA Reporting (`reports`):**
    *   The `reports` service can now generate complete SLA reports in both PDF (via `pdf-generator`) and JSON formats, storing them on S3.
    *   Data fetching from `faults`, `metrics`, and `schedules` services is now robust, allowing for accurate SLA calculations.
    *   Notification dispatch via `messenger` upon report completion is now active.

We continuously work on improving our services, and any deployed changes will be reflected in future changelog summaries.
