### Enhancements

*   Improved clarity for temporary port forwarding by including the access point address in the details, making it easier to understand how to connect.
*   Performance improvements for script operations: Optimized the process for validating target sites for script execution, leading to better overall system performance.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue with VPN subscription seat checks, ensuring correct enforcement of user and site limits based on your plan.

### Temporary Updates

*   Automatic collection of network inventory data (like ARP, CDP, DHCP) has been temporarily paused to allow for optimization work on our data collection methods. Manual or alternative data ingestion methods are still fully operational during this time.
