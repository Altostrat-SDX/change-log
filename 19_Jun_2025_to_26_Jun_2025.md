### New Features & Capabilities

*   **Enhanced AI Assistant Experience:** Our AI assistant has received a major upgrade, now featuring a new persona and offering more sophisticated interactions and comprehensive problem-solving. You'll experience it providing real-time "thoughts" as it processes requests, offering transparency into its investigation process.
*   **Speech-to-Text (STT) Capability:** A new API endpoint is now available, allowing you to transcribe audio files (up to 25MB, various formats like MP3, MP4, WAV, etc.) into text.
*   **Expanded AI Assistant Toolset:** The AI assistant can now leverage an extensive set of new tools to gather information and provide more accurate insights into your environment. This includes versatile access to platform data, comprehensive documentation, public web content retrieval, and detailed insights into site and network status, configuration, performance metrics, hardware specifications for managed devices, and live device commands.
*   **Customizable AI Behavior:** The core behavior of the AI assistant, including how it assesses problem complexity, formulates its thoughts, and utilizes tools, is now driven by external configuration, allowing for flexible tuning and adaptation.
*   **Comprehensive Billing & Subscription Management:** We've rolled out a brand new, highly flexible system for managing your subscriptions and metered resources.
    *   **Multi-Product Subscriptions:** Subscriptions now support multiple types of metered resources (e.g., users, locations, storage, API calls), each with its own customizable quantity, offering more precise control over your consumption.
    *   **Full Subscription Lifecycle:** New API endpoints allow you to dynamically pause, resume, add, and remove individual products from your existing subscriptions.
    *   **Real-time Billing Integration:** An automated webhook system now keeps your billing accounts and subscriptions seamlessly synchronized with your billing provider, ensuring your usage and billing data are always up-to-date.
    *   **Billing Account Limits:** Easily query and retrieve the current product limits configured for any of your billing accounts.
*   **Enhanced Organization Hierarchy & Resource Metering:** Manage your teams and resources with greater precision through improved organization structures and detailed metering.
    *   **Nested Organizations:** Create and manage organizations within a hierarchical (parent-child) structure.
    *   **Granular Resource Usage & Limits:** Each organization can now track its own usage and define specific limits for various metered resources (like user seats or storage).
    *   **Intuitive Hierarchy Navigation:** New API routes enable you to easily retrieve an organization's direct children, all its descendants, or its immediate parent within the hierarchy.
*   **Dedicated Workspace Migration Toolkit (Preview):** A robust set of new APIs designed to help you transition your workspaces to new billing models or structures, including migration analysis, atomic organization moves, and workspace archiving.
*   **Improved User Invitation & Access Control:**
    *   **Workspace Member Management:** New APIs facilitate the management of members within a workspace, allowing for the assignment and modification of roles (Owner, Admin, Viewer).
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implemented comprehensive authorization checks across all core resources to ensure users can only perform authorized actions.
*   **Bulk MAC Address Vendor Lookup API:** Introduced a new API endpoint allowing you to look up manufacturer information for multiple MAC addresses in a single request, significantly improving the efficiency of querying vendor data for several devices at once.

### Platform Enhancements & Optimizations

*   **Smarter AI Problem-Solving and Investigation:** The AI assistant now intelligently categorizes your requests. Simple questions receive direct, concise answers, while complex troubleshooting scenarios trigger a thorough, multi-tool analysis, preventing over-investigation and providing more relevant responses.
*   **Persistent AI Conversation Context:** AI conversation history is now securely stored, ensuring that the assistant remembers previous interactions and maintains context across sessions, even if the service restarts.
*   **Enhanced API Security and Performance:** Our authentication middleware has been improved with better audience handling, consistent user/organization ID extraction, and caching of tokens, leading to increased security and improved performance for API requests.
*   **Optimized Data Acquisition Strategy:** The scheduled automatic ARP data collection from network devices has been temporarily adjusted to support a transition towards a more dynamic, "live inventory" approach for network host data acquisition.
*   **Improved Connection Visibility:** API responses for transient ports now include the associated management server IP address, providing better visibility of connection details.
*   **Efficient Script Management Validation:** Internal optimizations have been implemented to improve the efficiency of validating selected sites when creating or updating scheduled scripts.
*   **Optimized Bulk MAC Lookup Limit:** The new bulk MAC address lookup API now supports up to 50 MAC addresses per request, balancing performance with resource utilization.
*   **Modernized Billing Data Storage:** The internal storage format for subscription product quantities has been upgraded, enhancing data integrity and improving query flexibility.
*   **Streamlined Billing Calculations:** Outdated legacy billing fields have been entirely removed, streamlining billing calculations and aligning with the new flexible metering system.
*   **Enhanced API Robustness and Validation:** Stronger API input validation for creating and updating Workspaces, Billing Accounts, and Organizations leads to more predictable behavior and clearer error messages.
*   **Increased AI Processing Capacity:** The maximum processing timeout for AI requests has been significantly extended to accommodate more in-depth and complex investigations without interruption.
*   **Improved Developer Tooling:** A new command has been introduced to streamline the creation of new AI tools for developers.
*   **Conversation History Cleaning Utility:** A new administrative utility has been introduced to help clean corrupted AI conversation histories from storage.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Accurate VPN Subscription Validation:** Resolved an issue where the validation of available subscription seats for creating new VPN peers was not always accurate, ensuring that seat allocations are now correctly verified based on your active subscription.
*   **Reliable AI Assistant Interactions:** Fixed issues where the AI might misclassify simple informational questions, leading to prolonged and irrelevant investigations, and addressed instances of the AI attempting to use incorrect or deprecated API endpoints.
*   **Stable AI Conversation History:** Corrected a bug that could lead to corrupted conversation history when the AI generated empty or malformed content.
*   **Consistent Organization Hierarchy Queries:** Corrected a critical bug in the organization repository that caused incorrect parsing of hierarchy data, ensuring accurate retrieval of nested organizations within the workspace.
*   **Database Update Consistency:** Resolved an internal inconsistency in database update method calls, improving the overall reliability of data modification operations.
