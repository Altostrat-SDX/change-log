This week brings transformative updates for MSPs and enterprises: a dramatically smarter AI assistant with real-time reasoning, flexible multi-product billing, and tools for managing complex organizational hierarchies.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Reimagined AI Assistant**: Major upgrade delivers sophisticated problem-solving with real-time "thought" streaming—showing you exactly how the AI investigates network issues. Enhanced with extensive new tools: live device commands, performance metrics analysis, hardware specifications lookup, and comprehensive documentation access. Perfect for complex troubleshooting and network discovery.
- **Speech-to-Text API**: Transcribe audio files (up to 25MB, MP3/MP4/WAV formats) into text—useful for voice-driven network management interfaces and documentation workflows.
- **Comprehensive Billing & Subscription System**: Complete overhaul enables flexible resource metering:
  - **Multi-Product Subscriptions**: Track multiple resource types (users, sites, storage, API calls) with individual quantities
  - **Dynamic Subscription Management**: API endpoints for pausing/resuming subscriptions and adding/removing products
  - **Real-Time Sync**: Automated webhook integration keeps billing data synchronized with your provider
  - **Billing Account Limits**: Query configured product limits for accurate capacity planning
- **Hierarchical Organization Management**: Build nested organization structures (parent-child) with granular resource metering:
  - Track usage and set limits per organization for user seats, sites, storage
  - Navigate hierarchy via API (retrieve children, descendants, parent)
  - Perfect for MSPs managing multiple clients with distinct resource allocations
- **Workspace Migration Toolkit (Preview)**: Robust APIs for transitioning workspaces to new billing models, including migration analysis, atomic organization moves, and workspace archiving.
- **Enhanced Access Control**:
  - **Workspace Member Management**: Assign and modify roles (Owner, Admin, Viewer) via API
  - **Role-Based Authorization**: Comprehensive RBAC checks across all core resources
- **Bulk MAC Vendor Lookup**: Query manufacturer information for multiple MAC addresses in one request—accelerates network discovery and inventory management.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Intelligent AI Investigation**: AI now categorizes requests—simple questions get direct answers, complex troubleshooting triggers multi-tool analysis. Prevents over-investigation and delivers relevant responses faster.
- **Persistent AI Context**: Conversation history securely stored ensures AI remembers previous interactions across sessions—essential for long troubleshooting investigations.
- **Enhanced API Security**: Improved authentication middleware with audience validation, consistent ID extraction, and token caching boosts security and performance.
- **Connection Visibility**: API responses for transient ports now include management server IP addresses.
- **Efficient Script Validation**: Optimized site selection validation when creating/updating scheduled scripts.
- **Bulk MAC Lookup Capacity**: Support for up to 50 MAC addresses per request balances performance with resource usage.
- **Modernized Billing Storage**: Upgraded subscription data format enhances integrity and query flexibility.
- **Streamlined Billing**: Removed legacy billing fields aligns calculations with new flexible metering system.
- **Robust API Validation**: Stronger input validation for Workspaces, Billing Accounts, Organizations delivers predictable behavior and clearer errors.
- **Extended AI Timeouts**: Increased processing capacity accommodates complex investigations without interruption.
- **ARP Data Strategy**: Adjusted automatic ARP collection to support transition toward dynamic "live inventory" approach.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Subscription Validation**: Fixed inaccurate Managed VPN peer seat availability checks
- **AI Reliability**: Corrected question misclassification and deprecated endpoint calls
- **Conversation Stability**: Prevented malformed content from corrupting AI history
- **Hierarchy Queries**: Fixed incorrect organization hierarchy data parsing
- **Database Consistency**: Resolved internal update method inconsistencies
