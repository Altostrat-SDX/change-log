This week marks a transformative release focused on automation, reporting intelligence, and operational flexibility. We're introducing sophisticated tag-based SLA reporting, complete API key management infrastructure, and a comprehensive suite of AI-powered network diagnostic tools that fundamentally enhance how you manage distributed MikroTik networks.

### 🎉 New Features

**Advanced SLA Reporting**

- **Dynamic Tag-Based Report Scheduling:** Create intelligent SLA report schedules that automatically select sites based on sophisticated tag-matching rules. Use flexible `OR` logic (match any) or `AND` logic (match all) to build powerful, rule-based reports that adapt as your network topology evolves, eliminating manual site selection and maintenance.
- **Tag-Based Site Grouping:** Automatically organize sites within SLA reports by any tag dimension to view aggregated performance metrics. For example, calculate average, minimum, or maximum uptime SLA for all sites in a specific region, customer account, or priority tier.
- **Advanced Metrics Query API:** Execute powerful PromQL queries directly against your network monitoring data through a new API endpoint, with full support for custom time ranges and data resolution control for building custom analytics and integrations.

**API & Automation Infrastructure**

- **Complete API Key Management:** Launch your machine-to-machine automation with a comprehensive API for managing service account authentication. Programmatically create, list, view, rotate, and delete API keys for your organization, enabling secure integration with CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, and custom automation tools.
- **Fine-Grained API Key Permissions:** Assign specific role-based permissions to each API key following the principle of least privilege, ensuring automated integrations have only the access they require for their intended function.
- **AI-Powered Network Diagnostic Suite:** Access a comprehensive collection of AI-driven tools that query your infrastructure, analyze active faults, inspect WAN connectivity status, manage Configuration Backups, and execute safe, read-only commands on MikroTik devices for troubleshooting.
- **Guided Diagnostic Workflows:** Simplify common network operations with intelligent, step-by-step guided prompts that help you analyze site health, obtain organization-wide operational overviews, and systematically troubleshoot connectivity issues.

**Enterprise Features**

- **Multi-Currency Billing Support:** Organizational billing accounts and subscriptions now support multiple currencies, which can be configured during workspace onboarding or via the API. This enables global MSPs to manage clients in their local currencies.
- **Custom Organizational Branding:** Personalize your SDX workspace with custom display names, login hints, and brand colors for your organization, creating a more cohesive experience aligned with your corporate identity.
- **Usage Data Export:** Export comprehensive organization usage reports for any workspace in both CSV and PDF formats directly through the API, supporting billing reconciliation, capacity planning, and compliance requirements.

**AI & Developer Experience**

- **Enhanced AI Engine Performance:** The AI Co-pilot is now faster and more efficient, utilizing a hybrid model strategy that intelligently routes requests to optimize response times. The system now better distinguishes between single-line code autocompletion requests and full RouterOS script generation, providing more contextually appropriate suggestions.
- **Advanced Admin & Developer Tools:** New command-line utilities help analyze AI token usage patterns, test third-party integrations, and manage system caches for operational efficiency.

### ✨ Enhancements

**SLA Reporting Infrastructure**

- **Redesigned Scheduling Engine:** The SLA report scheduling system has been completely rebuilt from scratch, delivering dramatically improved scalability, reliability, and performance to ensure reports are generated consistently and punctually.
- **More Resilient Report Generation:** The report generation pipeline now handles complex reports with many sites and metrics more robustly, with improved error handling and recovery mechanisms.

**API Performance & Reliability**

- **Accelerated API Key Authentication:** The API key authentication flow has been significantly optimized, resulting in much faster token exchange operations for machine-to-machine integrations.
- **Optimized Fault Queries:** Dramatically improved the performance of recent fault lookups, delivering faster load times for network operations dashboards and API-based monitoring integrations.
- **Enhanced Notification Delivery:** The reliability and speed of sending notifications to user accounts through various channels (email, webhooks, third-party services) have been substantially improved.

**Platform Governance & Security**

- **Enhanced Resource Limits:** Introduced new system-wide limits on resources including organizations per workspace, team members, and billing accounts to ensure platform stability and fair usage across multi-tenant environments.
- **Improved Payment Method Management:** Strengthened the Payment Methods API to prevent race conditions when multiple processes attempt to modify payment information simultaneously.
- **Auto-Recovery for Prefix Lists:** The platform now automatically recovers Prefix Lists stuck in "syncing" or "failed" states, allowing subsequent updates to proceed without manual intervention.
- **Comprehensive Dependency Updates:** Rolled out systematic updates to internal dependencies and core libraries across more than a dozen microservices, enhancing overall system performance, stability, and security.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Legacy Report Schedule Compatibility:** Fixed an issue where SLA report schedules created with older configuration formats could fail to load. All schedules now execute correctly regardless of creation date.
- **Organizational Capacity Calculations:** Resolved an incorrect capacity calculation in the Organization Limits API that could misreport available resources in hierarchical organization structures.
- **Organization Picture Management:** Corrected a bug that prevented proper removal of an organization's profile picture through the API.
- **Subscription Product Updates:** Fixed an issue where updating products within an existing subscription could fail under certain billing cycle combinations.
- **Workflow Special Character Handling:** Resolved a stability issue where Workflow Engine executions could fail when processing data containing null bytes or other special characters.
- **Fault Date Filtering:** Corrected a bug where date-based filtering for network faults didn't function correctly in all query scenarios.
- **Notification Metadata Handling:** Fixed an issue where notifications could fail to send for sites that lacked associated metadata tags.
- **Async Job API Flags:** Resolved an issue where asynchronous orchestration job requests could fail if optional flags were omitted from the API payload.
- **AI Tool Cache Security:** Fixed a security vulnerability in the AI tool caching mechanism that could potentially allow data leaks between user sessions.
