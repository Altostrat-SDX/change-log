This week, we're excited to introduce a suite of powerful new features focused on reporting, automation, and billing, along with significant performance and reliability improvements across the platform.

### ✨ New Features

**Reporting & Analytics**
- **Dynamic, Tag-Based Reports:** You can now create report schedules that dynamically select sites based on tags. Use flexible "match any" (OR) or "match all" (AND) logic to build powerful, rule-based reports without manual site selection.
- **Group Reports by Tag:** Automatically group report data by a specific tag to see aggregated results. For example, you can now easily view the average, minimum, or maximum SLA for all sites in a specific region.
- **New Metrics Query API:** A powerful new API endpoint is now available to execute PromQL queries directly against your metrics, complete with support for time ranges and data resolution control.

**API & Automation**
- **Full API Key Management:** We've launched a complete API for managing machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication. You can now programmatically create, list, view, rotate, and delete API keys for your organization.
- **Fine-Grained API Key Permissions:** When creating an API key, you can now assign specific permissions to ensure it has only the access it needs, following the principle of least privilege.
- **New Network Management & Diagnostic Tools:** A comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools is now available to query your infrastructure, view active faults, inspect WAN status, manage backups, and even run real-time, read-only commands on network devices.
- **Guided Diagnostic Prompts:** Simplify common tasks with new guided workflows that help you analyze site health, get an organization-wide overview, and troubleshoot connectivity issues step-by-step.

**Billing & Organization Management**
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Billing accounts and subscriptions now support multiple currencies, which can be set during the onboarding process or via the API.
- **Custom Organization Branding:** You can now set a custom display name, login hint, and brand colors for your organization to create a more personalized experience.
- **Export Usage Data:** Easily export a full organization usage report for a workspace in both CSV and PDF formats directly from the API.

**AI & Developer Tools**
- **Smarter Code Completion & AI Engine:** Our AI engine is now faster and more efficient, using a hybrid model strategy to reduce response times. It can now also better distinguish between requests for single-line autocompletion and full script generation, providing more relevant code suggestions.
- **New Developer & Admin Tools:** A new set of command-line tools is available to help analyze AI token usage, test integrations, and manage system caches.

### 🚀 Enhancements

**Reporting & Scheduling**
- **Upgraded Scheduling System:** The report scheduling engine has been completely redesigned for enhanced scalability and reliability, ensuring reports are generated consistently and on time.
- **More Resilient Report Generation:** We've improved the report generation pipeline to be more robust, better handling complex reports and improving overall performance.

**API & Performance**
- **Faster API Authentication:** The process of authenticating with an API Key has been significantly optimized, resulting in much faster token exchanges.
- **Optimized Recent Faults Query:** We've dramatically improved the performance of fetching recent faults, resulting in faster load times for dashboards and API clients.
- **More Reliable Notifications:** The performance and reliability of sending notifications to user accounts have been enhanced, ensuring faster delivery of messages.

**Platform Reliability & Security**
- **Improved System Limits:** To ensure stability and fair usage, we have introduced several new system limits on resources like organizations per workspace, members, and billing accounts.
- **Enhanced Payment Method Reliability:** We've improved the reliability of our Payment Methods API by preventing race conditions when modifying payment information.
- **Resilient Prefix List Updates:** The system can now automatically recover Prefix Lists that were stuck in a "syncing" or "failed" state, allowing updates to proceed smoothly.
- **General Stability & Security Updates:** We have rolled out routine updates to internal dependencies and core libraries across more than a dozen services to enhance overall system performance, stability, and security.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Reporting:** Fixed an issue where report schedules created with older settings could fail to load. All schedules now run correctly.
- **Billing & Organizations:** Resolved several issues, including an incorrect capacity calculation in the Organization Limits API, a bug preventing the removal of an organization's picture, and an issue where updating subscription products could fail.
- **Data & Workflows:** Fixed an issue where workflows could fail when processing data containing special characters (null bytes), improving stability. We also corrected a bug where date-based filtering for faults did not work correctly in all cases.
- **Notifications:** Fixed an issue where notifications could fail to send for sites that did not have associated metadata, improving message delivery reliability.
- **API & Authentication:** Resolved an issue where asynchronous job requests could fail if optional flags were not included. A security issue in our AI tool caching mechanism has been fixed to prevent any potential for data leaks between users.
