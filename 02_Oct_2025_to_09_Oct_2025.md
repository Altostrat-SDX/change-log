This week‚Äôs update introduces powerful new reporting and scanning capabilities, major workflow enhancements, and significant performance improvements across the platform.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Comprehensive SLA Reporting:** You can now generate detailed, multi-page Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports in PDF format. These reports provide a complete overview of site uptime, performance against targets, and in-depth downtime analysis, including breakdowns by cause like Power or Network issues.
*   **On-Demand Vulnerability Scans:** We've introduced the ability to run targeted vulnerability scans on a specific list of IP addresses. This gives you the flexibility to assess specific assets on-demand without needing to scan an entire network subnet.
*   **Advanced Workflow Logic with Tags:** Workflows are now more powerful with the new "Resource Has Tags" condition. You can build automation that checks if a resource has specific tags, a certain number of tags, or a particular key-value pair, allowing for more granular control.
*   **New Prefixed Site Identifiers:** To improve consistency and make scripting easier, all sites now have a new prefixed, time-sortable identifier available through our APIs.

### üöÄ Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Smarter, More Usable Reports:**
    *   Our new SLA reports feature a clean, modern design for better readability. Headers are now dynamically branded using a color from your organization's logo.
    *   For quicker insights, sites that have breached their SLA are now highlighted at the top of the report's site list.
    *   Navigating reports is easier than ever‚Äîsimply click a breached site's name in the summary to jump directly to its detailed incident log.
    *   For advanced integrations, you can now directly access the raw report data via a public JSON link.
*   **Platform Performance & Reliability:**
    *   We've significantly improved the speed and reliability of Dynamic DNS updates, ensuring IP changes for failover tunnels propagate more quickly.
    *   Device check-in processing is now more efficient. The system prioritizes critical events like reboots, handling less urgent updates in the background to improve overall responsiveness.
    *   The "Recent Sites" feature now loads much faster thanks to caching.
*   **Developer & Automation Experience:**
    *   Starting a multi-IP vulnerability scan is now instant. Your request is immediately queued for background processing, freeing you up to continue your work.
    *   Our AI-powered code completion now uses a more advanced model, providing higher-quality and more relevant code suggestions.
    *   The maximum execution time for synchronous workflows has been increased to 30 seconds, giving your longer-running automated tasks more time to complete.
    *   Configuring API actions in workflows is now more flexible and easier to debug, with clearer error messages that include the request body.
    *   Testing workflows is now more convenient, as test triggers will automatically use your defined input schema as a sample payload.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

*   **Reporting Accuracy:** We resolved several reporting issues, including one where PDF reports were missing detailed information for individual sites listed within a group. We also fixed bugs that prevented organization logos from displaying correctly and ensured WAN interface statistics are accurately mapped in incident logs.
*   **Data Integrity:** Fixed a bug where a site's "last seen from" IP address could occasionally be out of date. The API now reliably reflects the IP from the most recent device communication.
*   **Developer Tools:** Improved error handling for the code completion feature. You'll now receive a clearer message if a code suggestion is unavailable for any reason.
