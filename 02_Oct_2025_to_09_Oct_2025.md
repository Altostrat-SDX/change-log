This week introduces comprehensive SLA reporting capabilities, flexible vulnerability scanning options, and significantly more powerful workflow automation. Combined with numerous performance improvements, these updates enhance your ability to manage, monitor, and automate distributed MikroTik networks effectively.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Comprehensive PDF SLA Reports:** Generate professional, multi-page Service Level Agreement reports in PDF format for your MikroTik fleet. These detailed reports provide complete site uptime overviews, performance tracking against SLA targets, and in-depth downtime analysis with incident categorization by root cause (Power failures, Network issues, Device problems). Essential for customer reporting, internal SLAs, and compliance documentation.
- **On-Demand Targeted Vulnerability Scans:** Launch targeted vulnerability scans against specific IP address lists without scanning entire network subnets. This flexible capability enables security teams to assess specific assets on-demand, perfect for validating patch deployment, assessing new devices before production deployment, or investigating suspected compromises.
- **Tag-Based Workflow Conditions:** Dramatically enhance Workflow Engine capabilities with the new "Resource Has Tags" condition operator. Build sophisticated automation logic that checks whether sites, devices, or other resources have specific tag keys, values, tag counts, or key-value pairs. This enables dynamic, metadata-driven automation that adapts to your organizational structure.
- **Time-Sortable Site Identifiers:** All sites now include a new prefixed, time-sortable identifier accessible through APIs, improving consistency in integrations and making it easier to build chronologically sorted custom dashboards and reports.

### ✨ Enhancements

**SLA Reporting Improvements**

- **Professional Report Design:** SLA reports feature a clean, modern layout optimized for readability. Report headers are dynamically branded using colors extracted from your organization's logo for a professional, customized appearance.
- **Prioritized Breach Visibility:** Sites that have breached their SLA thresholds are prominently highlighted at the top of the report's site list, enabling immediate focus on problem areas.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Click any breached site name in the executive summary to jump directly to its detailed incident log within the PDF, streamlining report review and analysis.
- **Programmatic Data Access:** Access raw SLA report data directly via public JSON links for integration with external business intelligence tools, custom dashboards, or automated alerting systems.

**Platform Performance & Reliability**

- **Accelerated Dynamic DNS:** Significantly improved the speed and reliability of Dynamic DNS updates for Managed VPN failover tunnels, ensuring IP address changes propagate more quickly across your network infrastructure.
- **Optimized Device Check-Ins:** Enhanced device communication efficiency by prioritizing critical events (reboots, status changes) while processing routine updates in the background, improving platform responsiveness.
- **Faster Recent Sites Loading:** The "Recent Sites" feature now loads substantially faster thanks to intelligent caching strategies.

**Developer & Automation Experience**

- **Instant Scan Queueing:** Multi-IP vulnerability scan requests are now queued instantly for background processing, eliminating API wait times and enabling fire-and-forget scanning workflows.
- **Enhanced AI Code Completion:** Upgraded to a more advanced language model providing higher-quality, more contextually relevant RouterOS script suggestions and completions.
- **Extended Workflow Timeouts:** Increased maximum execution time for synchronous workflow runs from 15 to 30 seconds, accommodating longer-running orchestration tasks without requiring async execution.
- **Improved Workflow Debugging:** API action configuration in workflows now provides better validation feedback and clearer error messages including request body details, accelerating workflow development and troubleshooting.
- **Smart Test Payloads:** Workflow test triggers automatically use your defined input schema as sample payload data, simplifying testing and validation during development.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **SLA Report Completeness:** Resolved several rendering issues including missing detailed site information for grouped sites in PDF reports, incorrect organization logo display, and inaccurate WAN interface performance data mapping in incident logs.
- **Site Status Accuracy:** Fixed a data consistency issue where a site's "last seen from" IP address could occasionally be outdated. The API now reliably reflects the most recent device communication IP address.
- **AI Code Completion Reliability:** Improved error handling to provide clearer user feedback when code completion suggestions are temporarily unavailable due to service issues.
