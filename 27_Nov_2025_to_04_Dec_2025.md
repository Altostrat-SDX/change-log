## Weekly Update: December 4, 2025

This week, we're excited to introduce a powerful new way to save your custom settings, alongside key improvements to data ingestion and reporting reliability.

### ✨ New Features

*   **Configuration Management API:** A brand new API is now available for developers to programmatically store and manage user-specific settings. This powerful tool allows you to save preferences for custom dashboards, personalized report templates, and more, making it easier to create tailored experiences.

### 🚀 Enhancements

*   **More Flexible Data Submission:** We've made our metrics ingestion more convenient. You can now send data without a timestamp, and we'll automatically use the time of submission. Additionally, metric names are now automatically standardized to a common format, giving you more flexibility in naming conventions.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **Improved Report Reliability:** We've made report generation more resilient. Reports will now complete successfully even if a connected network device provides incomplete information, ensuring you always get your data.
*   **Accurate Scheduled Reports:** We fixed an issue that could cause scheduled reports using multiple tag-based rules to select the wrong sites. Your scheduled reports will now always include the correct set of locations.
