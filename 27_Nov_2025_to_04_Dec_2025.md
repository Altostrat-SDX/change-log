This week brings enhanced flexibility for managing your SDX platform preferences alongside key improvements to data collection and reporting reliability across your MikroTik fleet.

### ✨ New Features

- **Custom Configuration Management API:** Developers can now programmatically store and manage user-specific settings through a new API. This powerful tool enables you to save preferences for custom dashboards, personalized SLA report templates, and other tailored configurations, making it easier to create experiences optimized for your specific network management workflows.

### 🚀 Enhancements

- **More Flexible Metrics Ingestion:** We've streamlined how performance data is submitted to your SDX platform. You can now send metrics without explicitly specifying a timestamp—the system automatically uses the submission time. Additionally, metric names are now automatically normalized to a standard format, giving you greater flexibility in how you name custom metrics for your network monitoring.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Improved SLA Report Reliability:** Report generation is now more resilient when collecting data from your distributed network. SLA reports will complete successfully even if a MikroTik device provides incomplete information during the collection window, ensuring you always receive your scheduled uptime and performance reports.
- **Accurate Tag-Based Report Scheduling:** We fixed an issue that could cause scheduled SLA reports using multiple tag-based selection rules to include the wrong sites. Your tag-based reports now consistently select the correct locations based on your configured `AND`/`OR` logic, ensuring accurate fleet-wide performance tracking.
