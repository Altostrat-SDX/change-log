### Highlights this Week

We've focused on enhancing how you manage network access controls, specifically around Walled Garden configurations.

### New Features

*   **Typed Walled Garden Entries:** You can now assign specific types to Walled Garden entries, starting with support for authentication-related entries. This lays the groundwork for different validation rules and processing based on the entry's purpose, improving configuration clarity and control.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Walled Garden Validation:** For typed Walled Garden entries related to authentication, we've implemented stricter validation. The system now checks that specified IP addresses or ranges are correctly located within the subnets assigned to your specific network access instances, preventing misconfigurations and enhancing security.
*   **API Update for Walled Gardens:** The API resource for Walled Garden entries now includes the new `type` field, providing developers and integrators with more detailed information for easier management.

### Bug Fixes

*   No user-facing bug fixes were required this week.
