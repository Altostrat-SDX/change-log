This week, we're excited to introduce a powerful new suite of APIs for metrics and dashboards, alongside a dedicated search for our documentation. We've also shipped significant enhancements to our scanning and monitoring capabilities to give you richer, more reliable data.

### 🚀 New Features

*   **Metrics & Dashboard API:** You can now programmatically access your time-series metrics and dashboard data. This new API allows you to execute custom queries, discover available metrics, and pull data for any dashboard, opening up new possibilities for custom integrations and reporting.
*   **Documentation Search:** We've launched a new search endpoint exclusively for our product documentation and API references. Find the answers you need faster than ever.
*   **Detailed Network Interface Monitoring:** Gain deeper visibility into your network's health. We now collect detailed statistics for network interfaces, including traffic counters, errors, link status, and uptime.
*   **Automatic Logo Onboarding:** To help personalize your experience from day one, we now automatically discover and apply your organization's logo based on your email domain during the signup process.

### ✨ Enhancements

*   **Richer Scan Results:** Network scans are now more insightful and resilient. Results include more detailed host information like device manufacturer and standardized service names. We’ve also enriched vulnerability data with publication dates and reference links to help you prioritize.
*   **Smarter AI Insights:** The generation of AI-powered summaries in your scan reports is now more robust, ensuring you always get actionable insights, even when processing a large number of vulnerabilities.
*   **Improved Platform Performance & Reliability:** We've made numerous backend improvements to increase speed and stability. This includes optimizing data caching, making our health checks more resilient, and improving the data ingestion pipeline for metrics to ensure it's faster and more reliable.
*   **More Intelligent Device Management:** We can now deliver more precise configuration updates to your managed devices based on their specific firmware version, ensuring maximum compatibility and performance.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   **VPN Configuration Downloads:** We corrected an issue that could prevent the download of VPN configuration files and QR codes, ensuring client setup links now work reliably.
*   **Subscription Management:** We resolved a bug in subscription management, allowing you to seamlessly add, update, or remove products with different billing cycles (e.g., monthly and yearly) in a single subscription.
*   **Scan Result Accuracy:** Fixed an issue where hosts from different sites could be incorrectly grouped together in scan results. Host data is now always reported on a per-site basis.
*   **Metrics API Security:** Improved data isolation within the new Metrics API to ensure complex queries are always securely filtered for your organization.
