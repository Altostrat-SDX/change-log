We're excited to bring you this week's updates, focusing on improving the platform's security insights and overall reliability.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Vulnerability Insights:** We've made significant performance improvements to how you view security vulnerabilities associated with specific devices. This update provides a faster and more accurate overview of potential risks across multiple scans and devices.
*   **Smarter Mitigation Suggestions:** Our AI model for suggesting steps to fix vulnerabilities has been updated, aiming to provide more relevant and actionable recommendations to help you address issues effectively.
*   **API Streamlining & Compatibility:** We've simplified one of the API endpoints for accessing vulnerability data by removing an unused filter. Additionally, we've improved compatibility for API requests made from different sources, making integration smoother.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Correct Vulnerability Grouping:** Fixed an issue that prevented the correct grouping and display of the same vulnerability found on a device across multiple scans or different hosts. This ensures you have a clearer picture of your security posture.
*   **Reliable API Backup Requests:** Resolved a problem that could occasionally prevent direct backup requests initiated via the API from completing successfully, ensuring your automated backups run reliably.
