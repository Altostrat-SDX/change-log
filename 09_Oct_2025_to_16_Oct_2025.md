This week marks a major release focused on network security granularity, reporting intelligence, and infrastructure reliability. These capabilities provide network administrators with sophisticated tools for managing security policies and gaining deeper insights into network performance across distributed MikroTik deployments.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Security Groups & Prefix Lists for Advanced Firewall Control:** Introducing a powerful new framework for managing stateful firewall rules across your MikroTik fleet. **Security Groups** enable you to define sophisticated, template-based firewall policies that can be applied consistently across sites. **Prefix Lists** provide reusable IP address and subnet collections that simplify managing complex allow/deny lists. New reference API endpoints help you discover supported network protocols and services for precise rule configuration.
- **Intelligent Tag-Based SLA Reporting:** Transform how you track network performance with dynamic, tag-based report scheduling. Create SLA reports that automatically include sites matching specific tags (e.g., `Location: New York`, `Customer: Acme`), and group results by complementary tag dimensions to view aggregated SLA metrics for regions, customers, or departments. Reports adapt automatically as your network topology evolves.
- **Comprehensive WAN Performance Analysis:** SLA reports now automatically include detailed WAN link breakdowns for sites that breach their uptime thresholds. Each WAN interface receives a dedicated section showing uptime percentage, ISP information, fault counts, and total downtime—essential data for troubleshooting connectivity issues and managing ISP relationships.
- **Enhanced Managed VPN Authentication:** Launched a new, secure API endpoint dedicated to Managed VPN client authentication and routing configuration delivery. This infrastructure enhancement improves the reliability and manageability of secure remote connections across your distributed network.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Accelerated Platform Performance:** Comprehensive performance optimizations across the platform deliver noticeably faster operations. Site list loading is substantially quicker, and device check-in processing is more efficient, improving overall system responsiveness and stability when managing large MikroTik fleets.
- **Rebuilt SLA Report Engine:** The report scheduling and generation system has been completely redesigned from the ground up for dramatically improved reliability. Reports are now generated more accurately and consistently, with refined data prioritization that highlights the most critical network incidents and improves calculation accuracy throughout.
- **More Reliable Dynamic DNS Updates:** The dynamic DNS update system has been significantly hardened for improved efficiency and reliability. Sites on networks with frequently changing IP addresses now experience faster, more consistent DNS updates, essential for maintaining stable Managed VPN and remote access connectivity.
- **Enhanced Developer Experience:** Expanded CORS support enables easier web application integration. Improved validation for Security Group rules provides clearer feedback during configuration. Resource update operations are safer and more consistent, with better conflict resolution. VPN authentication responses now include additional identifiers useful for monitoring and automation integrations.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **SLA Report Accuracy:** Resolved an issue causing incorrect site counts in report summaries when using dynamic tag-based site selection. Fixed a data handling bug that could prevent proper report generation for grouped sites, ensuring reliable aggregated metrics.
