This week, we‚Äôre excited to roll out a major update focused on giving you more granular security controls, deeper insights through advanced reporting, and a faster, more reliable platform experience.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Advanced Security Management with Security Groups & Prefix Lists:** We've introduced a powerful new way to manage your network security. You can now create stateful firewall rules using **Security Groups** and define reusable IP address collections with **Prefix Lists**. To make configuration easier, we've also added new reference API endpoints to look up supported network protocols and services.
*   **Dynamic, Tag-Based Reporting:** Reporting is now smarter and more flexible. You can schedule reports that dynamically select sites based on tags (e.g., `Location: New York`). You can also group results by another tag to see aggregate SLA metrics for entire regions or departments.
*   **Deep-Dive WAN Performance in Reports:** Gain deeper insights into connectivity issues. SLA reports for sites that breach their threshold now automatically include a detailed breakdown of each WAN link's performance, including uptime percentage, ISP info, fault counts, and total downtime.
*   **New VPN Authentication Service:** We've launched a new, secure API endpoint for VPN clients to authenticate and receive their specific routing configurations. This enhances the reliability and management of secure remote connections.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Faster Platform Performance:** We've optimized several key areas of the platform. You'll notice faster load times for the main site list and recent sites list. Behind the scenes, we've made device check-ins more efficient, improving overall system stability and responsiveness.
*   **More Reliable Reporting Engine:** The report scheduling system has been completely redesigned for greater reliability, ensuring your reports are generated accurately and on time. We've also refined the data in generated reports, prioritizing the most critical incidents and improving the clarity and accuracy of all calculations.
*   **Improved Dynamic DNS Reliability:** The system that updates Dynamic DNS records has been made significantly more robust and efficient. This results in faster and more reliable updates for sites on networks with frequently changing IP addresses.
*   **Developer & API Experience:** For developers using our API, we've enabled Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for easier integration with web applications, improved validation for security rules, and made resource updates safer and more consistent. We also expanded the data returned during VPN authentication to include more useful identifiers.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

*   **Reporting Accuracy:** We resolved an issue that could cause an incorrect site count in report summaries when using dynamic tags. We also fixed a bug to improve data handling and prevent errors when generating reports for grouped sites.
