We're excited to share the latest updates and improvements deployed this week to make your experience even better!

### What's New

*   **Multi-Device Vulnerability Scanning:** You can now easily retrieve vulnerability data for multiple devices simultaneously using a new API capability, streamlining your security monitoring workflows.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Faster Traffic Reports:** Loading times for DNS and BGP traffic reports have been significantly improved. To provide quicker access to the most current information, these reports now display data from the last 1 day (previously 2 days).
*   **Enhanced Data Consistency:** Improved the consistency and reliability of how dates are formatted within API responses, particularly for vulnerability data.
*   **Increased System Reliability:** Refinements were made to internal scheduling for automated backups and increased internal system timeouts to improve the overall reliability of background data processing and scheduled tasks.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Corrected Date Formatting:** Resolved an issue where dates provided in API responses, especially within vulnerability data lists, might be incorrectly formatted. Dates are now consistently parsed and returned correctly.
