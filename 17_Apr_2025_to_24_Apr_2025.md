This week streamlines security monitoring with bulk vulnerability scanning and delivers faster reporting across DNS Content Filtering and BGP Threat Mitigation services.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Bulk Vulnerability Scanning API**: Retrieve vulnerability data for multiple MikroTik devices simultaneously—dramatically streamlining security monitoring workflows. Essential for MSPs managing security across large device fleets.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Accelerated Traffic Reports**: DNS Content Filtering and BGP Threat Mitigation traffic reports load significantly faster. Reports now show last 24 hours (optimized from 48 hours) for quicker access to current data—critical for incident response and security analysis.
- **Consistent Date Formatting**: Improved timestamp consistency in API responses, especially for vulnerability data—simplifies parsing in security automation tools.
- **Enhanced Schedule Reliability**: Refined Configuration Backup scheduling and increased system timeouts improve reliability of background data processing and scheduled tasks.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Corrected API Date Parsing**: Fixed incorrect date formatting in vulnerability API responses—dates now consistently parsed and returned
