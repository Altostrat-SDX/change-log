Stay better informed with new email notifications, leverage enhanced AI diagnostics, and manage configurations at scale with the new bulk backup API.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Comprehensive Email Notifications**: New alerts keep you informed of critical events:
  - Vulnerability scan start/completion with reports ready for review
  - Scheduled SLA report generation and delivery
  - Individual WAN interface status changes (down/recovered)
  - Captive Portal coupon generation with PDF attachments
  - Managed VPN credential creation for users
- **Enhanced AI Diagnostics**: AI's new universal `metadata` tool retrieves detailed configuration and status for any resource—delivering more comprehensive answers to complex network questions.
- **Bulk Configuration Backup API**: New endpoint (`POST /api/backups/latest`) retrieves latest backups for up to 50 sites in one request—dramatically reducing API overhead for compliance verification and disaster recovery validation.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Faster AI Diagnostics**: AI can now run multiple diagnostic tools in parallel—significantly accelerating complex network investigations. Improved reliability for `ping`/`traceroute` commands with extended timeouts.
- **Enhanced API Capabilities**:
  - Key metrics endpoints now support `GET` requests for conventional data retrieval
  - Synchronous API accepts structured array data for flexible command execution
  - Increased maximum execution time supports complex operations
- **Improved Firewall Configuration**: Single IP addresses in Firewall Trusted Networks automatically convert to CIDR notation (`10.0.0.1` → `10.0.0.1/32`)—reducing configuration errors.
- **System Reliability**: Enhanced scheduled report generation, notification delivery, and Captive Portal coupon processing ensure stable platform performance at scale.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Fixed incorrect pagination status in filtered API responses
- Corrected Captive Portal coupon notification email subject and template
- Improved "WAN Interface Down" alert subject line clarity
