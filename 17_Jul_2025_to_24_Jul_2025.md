This week is packed with exciting updates designed to keep you better informed, enhance our AI's capabilities, and provide powerful new tools for developers. We've also focused on improving system reliability and squashing a few bugs.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Stay Informed with New Notifications**: We've rolled out a suite of new email notifications to keep you up-to-date on important events. You'll now receive alerts when:
    *   A vulnerability scan starts and its report is ready for review.
    *   A scheduled SLA report has been generated.
    *   An individual WAN interface goes down or recovers.
    *   Captive Portal coupons are generated and ready for distribution (PDF attached).
    *   VPN credentials have been created for a user.

*   **A More Powerful AI Assistant**: Our AI assistant is now smarter and more capable! A new universal `metadata` tool allows it to retrieve detailed configuration and status information for any resource, leading to more comprehensive and accurate answers.

*   **Efficiently Manage Backups via API**: For our developers and integrators, we've introduced a new bulk API endpoint (`POST /api/backups/latest`) that allows you to retrieve the latest backup content for up to 50 sites in a single request. This dramatically reduces the number of API calls needed to gather configuration data across your sites.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Faster and More Reliable AI**: The AI can now run multiple diagnostic tools at the same time, significantly speeding up complex investigations and getting you answers faster. We've also improved its ability to run live diagnostic commands like `ping` and `traceroute` and increased timeouts for better reliability on long-running tasks.

*   **API and Developer Experience**: We've made several improvements to our APIs:
    *   Key metrics endpoints now support `GET` requests for more conventional data retrieval.
    *   The Synchronous API now accepts structured data (arrays), offering more flexibility.
    *   We've increased the maximum execution time for API requests to better support complex operations.

*   **Improved User Experience**: Configuring firewall policies is now easier. Single IP addresses entered into 'Trusted Networks' are automatically converted to the correct CIDR format (e.g., `10.0.0.1` becomes `10.0.0.1/32`), saving you a step.

*   **System Performance and Reliability**: We've made several under-the-hood improvements to ensure a more stable and reliable experience. This includes making our scheduled reporting system more robust, enhancing the reliability of our notification delivery system, and optimizing how scheduled Captive Portal coupons are generated to ensure platform performance.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue where the pagination status in API responses could be incorrect when using a search filter, ensuring you can reliably page through all results.
*   Corrected the subject line and template for the new Captive Portal coupon notification email.
*   Adjusted the wording in the "Network Down" alert subject line for better clarity and grammar.
