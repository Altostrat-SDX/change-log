### What's New This Week

We're excited to announce several new features designed to keep you better informed and make your operations more efficient:

*   **Expanded Email Notifications:** Stay on top of critical events with new email alerts for:
    *   Changes in **Wide Area Network (WAN) interface status**, notifying you when an interface goes offline or recovers.
    *   The availability of your **Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports**, including key performance metrics and a direct link to the report.
    *   **Vulnerability scan events**, keeping you informed from start to detailed completion reports.
    *   Direct email delivery of **Captive Portal Coupons**, complete with details like quantity, workflow, expiration, and a link to a printable PDF.
*   **Efficient Backup Retrieval API:** A new API endpoint now allows you to fetch the latest backup content for multiple sites in a single request. This significantly reduces the number of API calls needed, making it faster and more efficient to query backup data for many sites at once.

### Enhancements & Improvements

This week brings a range of enhancements focused on reliability, flexibility, and user experience:

*   **Improved Reporting Reliability:** Scheduled SLA reports are now more consistent and robust, with enhanced handling to ensure your daily, weekly, and monthly reports are managed seamlessly, even during peak activity.
*   **Flexible API Data Access:** Our data retrieval APIs have been updated with new GET endpoints, providing more standard and user-friendly ways to access your network information, including interface metrics and WAN ping statistics for your sites.
*   **Enhanced Network Configuration:** Security policies now benefit from stricter validation and automatic normalization for network inputs, ensuring your network rules are consistently stored and applied for greater reliability.
*   **More Robust Email Delivery:** Our entire email notification system has been upgraded to a new, more reliable platform. This provides more flexible message templating and significantly improves the overall deliverability and consistency of your email communications. Network down alerts also now include clearer, more user-friendly duration reporting.
*   **API Flexibility & Reliability:**
    *   The API for sending commands to devices now supports arrays of values in the `parameters` field, offering greater flexibility for advanced configurations.
    *   Processing for longer-running commands initiated through the API has been made more reliable with increased timeouts.
*   **System Stability & Efficiency:**
    *   Improvements have been made to the internal validation of notification recipients, leading to more robust alert delivery.
    *   The maximum number of coupons that can be generated per coupon schedule run has been adjusted to ensure system stability and efficient resource allocation.

### Key Bug Fixes

We've addressed important issues this week to ensure smooth operation:

*   **Critical Email Recipient Fix:** Resolved an issue that was redirecting emails to an internal test address. All emails will now correctly reach their intended recipients.
*   **Accurate Email Templates:** Corrected template and subject line issues for Captive Portal Coupon emails, ensuring they display correctly.
*   **Minor Email Grammar:** Fixed a small grammatical error in network down alert email subject lines for improved readability.
