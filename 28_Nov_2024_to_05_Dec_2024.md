### ✨ Platform Enhancements

Our focus this week was on essential internal maintenance and stability improvements across core SDX services—ensuring continued reliability, performance, and security:

*   **Authentication & Authorization**: Refined OAuth flows and token validation for enhanced security
*   **Device Management**: Optimized event publishing and device communication for better stability
*   **MikroTik Device Control**: Improved job queuing and heartbeat processing for increased reliability
*   **Metadata Services**: Performance tuning for faster asset and metadata access
*   **Managed VPN**: Hardened VPN server provisioning logic on cloud infrastructure
*   **WAN Failover**: Enhanced OpenVPN tunnel management reliability
*   **Static IP Management**: Improved RADIUS integration stability
*   **Monitoring & Alerting**: Streamlined data ingestion pipelines for metrics and fault tracking
*   **Log Management**: Optimized query performance
*   **Notification Delivery**: Enhanced dispatch mechanism reliability

These foundational improvements ensure long-term platform health and scalability.
