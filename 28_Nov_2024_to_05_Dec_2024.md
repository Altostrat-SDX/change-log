### Platform Stability and Maintenance (Nov 28 - Dec 5)

This week, our focus was primarily on essential internal maintenance, foundational hardening, and stability improvements across our core microservices that were brought online in previous weeks. These efforts are crucial for ensuring the continued reliability, performance, and security of the platform, laying a robust groundwork for future feature enhancements.

**Key Areas of Internal Focus:**

*   **Authentication & Authorization (`auth`):** Refinements to OAuth flows and token validation processes to enhance security and reliability.
*   **Device & Network Control (`control-plane`, `mikrotik`):** Optimization of event publishing mechanisms from `control-plane` for better inter-service communication. Improvements to the `mikrotik` service's job queuing and heartbeat processing for increased device management stability.
*   **Metadata Services (`metadata`):** Performance tuning for DynamoDB interactions and S3 asset handling to ensure efficient metadata and file access.
*   **Networking Services (`vpn`, `wan-failover`, `elastic-ip`):** Hardening of provisioning logic for VPN servers on Vultr (`vpn` service) and reliability improvements for OpenVPN tunnel management (`wan-failover`). Enhanced stability for RADIUS integration within `elastic-ip`.
*   **Monitoring & Core Utilities (`metrics`, `logs`, `faults`, `messenger`):** Streamlining data ingestion pipelines for `metrics` and `faults`. Optimized query performance for the `logs` service. Enhanced reliability of the `messenger` service's dispatch mechanisms.

While this period concentrated on foundational work vital for the long-term health and scalability of the platform, we appreciate your understanding. We look forward to sharing more user-facing updates in the coming weeks.
