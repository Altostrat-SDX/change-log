This week delivers a major leap in automation capabilities: chain workflows together for complex, modular automations; respond instantly to network status changes; and get proactive alerts for WAN quality issues.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Workflow Chaining**: Build sophisticated, modular automations by triggering workflows from other workflows. Create reusable building blocks (e.g., "Provision VPN", "Configure Firewall", "Send Report") and chain them together into complex sequences. New API endpoint helps you discover and invoke triggerable workflows programmatically.
- **Real-Time Network Status Events**: Instantly respond to network changes with new event triggers: site online/offline, WAN tunnel online/offline. Automate incident response, send notifications, trigger diagnostics, or orchestrate failover procedures the moment a status change occurs.
- **Proactive WAN Quality Alerts**: Automatically detect when packet loss on a WAN tunnel exceeds critical thresholds. Get notified immediately so you can investigate before customers report problems—essential for meeting SLAs and maintaining uptime.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Workflow Safety & Testing**:
  - Dependency protection prevents deleting workflows that are referenced by others (avoids breaking automation chains)
  - Circular dependency detection prevents infinite loops in chained workflows
  - Sample event data in the workflow test editor accelerates event-driven automation development
- **Enhanced Network Monitoring**:
  - Improved accuracy for WAN latency and packet loss statistics
  - Tunnels API now includes external IP addresses for each WAN link—essential for troubleshooting and documentation
- **Faster AI Assistant**: Optimized response times for platform-related questions
- **Platform Infrastructure**: Security, reliability, and performance improvements across the stack

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Workflows**:
  - Fixed critical issue preventing event-triggered workflows from executing
  - API action now handles empty responses gracefully without failing
  - Resolved workflow editor issues and chaining functionality bugs
- **Alerts & Notifications**:
  - Corrected packet loss alert delivery configuration
  - Fixed notification delays for newly created sites
- **General**:
  - Resolved deleted sites lingering temporarily in site lists
