This week, we're excited to roll out a major upgrade to our automation engine with the introduction of Workflow Chaining! We've also launched new real-time network events and proactive alerts to give you even more power and insight. Check out all the details below.

### üöÄ New Features

- **Build Complex Automations with Workflow Chaining**: You can now create more powerful and modular automations by triggering one workflow from another. This allows you to build reusable automation blocks for complex sequences. A new API endpoint is also available to easily find and select triggerable workflows.
- **Real-Time Network Status Events**: The platform now broadcasts real-time events whenever a site or WAN tunnel goes online or offline. Use these events to trigger automated notifications, diagnostic workflows, or failover procedures instantly.
- **Proactive Packet Loss Alerts**: Get ahead of potential network issues with new automated alerts. The system will now notify you whenever packet loss on a WAN tunnel exceeds a critical threshold, enabling a faster response.

### ‚ú® Enhancements

- **Smarter and Safer Workflows**:
  - To prevent accidental disruptions, you can no longer delete a workflow that is being used by another.
  - The editor now automatically detects and prevents circular dependencies (e.g., infinite loops) in your chained workflows.
  - Building and testing event-driven workflows is now easier with sample data provided directly in the test editor.
- **More Accurate Network Monitoring & Data**:
  - We've improved the accuracy of latency and packet loss statistics for WAN link monitoring.
  - The Tunnels API endpoint now includes the external IP for each configured WAN link, providing more comprehensive data for your integrations.
- **Faster AI Assistance**: Our AI assistant's ability to answer questions about the platform has been optimized, resulting in faster and more efficient responses.
- **Platform Security & Performance**: We've made numerous under-the-hood improvements to enhance the security, reliability, and performance of the platform.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

- **Workflows**:
  - Fixed a critical issue that prevented event-triggered workflows from executing correctly.
  - The API action within workflows is now more resilient and no longer fails on an empty API response.
  - Resolved several smaller issues in the workflow editor and the new chaining functionality to ensure a smooth experience.
- **Alerts & Notifications**:
  - Corrected a configuration error that was blocking some packet loss alerts from being delivered.
  - Addressed an issue that could cause delays in notifications and updates for newly created sites.
- **General**:
  - Fixed a bug that could cause deleted sites to temporarily linger in site lists.
