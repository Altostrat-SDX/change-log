### What's New

*   **Real-Time Network Packet Loss Notifications:** Stay informed immediately with new system-level notifications that alert you when a network tunnel experiences significant packet loss and again when the issue is resolved. This provides timely awareness of your network's health.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Proactive Network Monitoring:** We've refined our network monitoring thresholds to detect potential packet loss issues even earlier, allowing for quicker identification and response to network performance changes.
*   **Enhanced Network Configuration Visibility:** Our API responses for network tunnels now include additional details, such as anycast IP addresses, offering a more complete and comprehensive view of your network configuration.
*   **More Accurate Network Status Reporting:** The underlying logic for monitoring network links has been strengthened with more robust ping checks, leading to even more precise and reliable updates on tunnel status and latency.
*   **Improved System Responsiveness and Data Consistency:** We've made significant enhancements to how our internal systems communicate about critical events like the creation or deletion of sites and the processing of jobs. This leads to more reliable, real-time updates across integrated services, ensuring better overall system responsiveness and data consistency.
*   **Core System Stability and Performance:** Various internal components and libraries have been updated to their latest versions, contributing to overall system stability, performance, and security.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Real-Time Site Overview:** We've addressed an issue to ensure that your site list updates immediately after a site is deleted or disassociated. Your site overview will now always reflect the most current information.
*   **Reliable System-Wide Updates:** Fixed issues to ensure that all integrated systems consistently receive notifications for newly created sites and all changes in network or site fault status. This significantly improves the reliability of automated responses and critical alerts.
