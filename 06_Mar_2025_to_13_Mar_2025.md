This week, we're excited to roll out significant updates across the platform, bringing powerful new features, key enhancements, and important bug fixes to improve your experience, especially focusing on network access management and tunnel capabilities.

### New Features

*   **Expanded Coupon Management:** We've introduced comprehensive coupon functionality for the captive portal. You can now create and manage coupon codes for authentication, set up recurring schedules for automatic generation, manually trigger code creation, view detailed usage metrics, and generate temporary, secure links to share coupon lists easily.
*   **Detailed User Information (Admin):** The administrative interface now provides richer details about connected users, including their MAC Address, Hostname, and Manufacturer.
*   **Dedicated Coupon Success Page:** Users who successfully authenticate using a coupon are now directed to a specific page confirming their access.
*   **Dynamic DNS for Network Tunnels:** Each network tunnel is now assigned a unique dynamic hostname that automatically updates whenever the tunnel's public IP address changes, making it easier to maintain connectivity.
*   **Enhanced Email Notifications:** We've added new, detailed email templates for important events, including alerts for network outages and notifications specifically for generated Captive Portal coupon batches, complete with download links.
*   **Generate Coupon PDFs:** A new capability allows you to generate customizable PDF documents containing lists of coupon codes, perfect for printing or distribution.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Coupon Session Consistency:** Sessions started via coupons now consistently adhere to the standard session duration configured for the captive portal instance.
*   **Streamlined Coupon Lists:** When accessing coupon lists programmatically, they are now sorted to show the most recently created codes first.
*   **More Robust Coupon Generation:** Reliability improvements have been made to the process for generating large volumes of coupon codes via schedules.
*   **Dynamic DNS Stability:** Rate limiting has been implemented to ensure stable updates for tunnel dynamic hostnames.
*   **Email Delivery Performance:** The system for sending emails has been enhanced with dedicated processing queues and rate limiting for improved reliability and speed.
*   **Refined Email Presentation:** Minor adjustments have been made to the default sender name (when a specific site name isn't provided) and subject lines for clarity in various notification emails.
*   **Alert Message Clarity:** Minor adjustments were made to the message format for Site Offline alerts.

### Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue where API requests for coupon lists might incorrectly include expired coupons.
*   Fixed a bug preventing coupons generated by automatic schedules from being correctly linked back to their schedule.
*   Corrected messages displayed on the coupon login page to clearly differentiate between expired and already-used coupons.
*   Addressed a permissions issue affecting the ability to download PDF files containing generated coupon codes.
*   Ensured that coupons generated by a schedule are automatically removed when that schedule is deleted.
*   Corrected issues with placeholder text and the PDF download link within the Captive Portal Coupons email template.
