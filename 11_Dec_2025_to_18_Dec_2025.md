As we approach the holiday season, this week has been focused on behind-the-scenes improvements to ensure your SDX platform runs smoothly throughout the break. While there are no major new features to announce, our team has been hard at work on infrastructure stability and planning for an exciting 2026.

### ⚙️ Platform Stability & Performance

- **Infrastructure Maintenance:** We've completed routine maintenance across our core platform services, including database optimization, security patches, and performance tuning to ensure reliable operation during the holiday period.
- **Monitoring Enhancements:** Our internal monitoring and alerting systems have been upgraded to proactively detect and resolve any potential issues, keeping your MikroTik fleet connected and managed without interruption.
- **Capacity Planning:** We've scaled our infrastructure to handle growing usage and ensure fast, responsive performance as more organizations adopt the SDX platform for their network management needs.

### 🔮 Looking Ahead

Our engineering teams are preparing several exciting features for early 2026, including enhanced automation capabilities, expanded reporting options, and new security features. We look forward to sharing these with you in the new year.
