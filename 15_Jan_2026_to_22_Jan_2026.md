This week delivers greater flexibility in communications and automation, making it easier to create engaging notifications and quickly troubleshoot automated processes across your SDX platform.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **More Powerful Custom Email Notifications:** Creating compelling email notifications for your network operations is now significantly more flexible. You can easily customize email templates with custom headings, preview text for email clients, personalized greetings based on recipient data, and prominent call-to-action buttons. This enhancement is particularly useful for MSPs managing multiple client networks or enterprises with branded communication requirements.
- **Faster Workflow Troubleshooting:** We've made the Workflow Engine debugging experience substantially faster and more precise. When a workflow that processes multiple items (such as updating configurations across several sites) encounters an error, you'll now see exactly which specific items failed and why. This targeted error reporting helps you resolve automation issues more quickly, minimizing the time your workflows spend in a failed state.
- **Flexible Authentication Realm Configuration:** Setting up authentication Realms for network access is now more streamlined. Realms can be created and modified without requiring an initial group assignment, giving you greater flexibility during initial configuration and making it easier to prepare authentication infrastructure before deploying access policies to your MikroTik fleet.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Email Notification Reliability:** We've improved the robustness of the email notification pipeline to ensure your workflow-triggered alerts and system notifications are delivered reliably, even when optional metadata fields are not provided. This fix eliminates intermittent delivery failures that could occur with simplified notification payloads.
- **Realm Search Accuracy:** We resolved an issue where searching for an authentication Realm by its exact name could sometimes fail to return results. Realm searches now consistently locate the correct configuration, making it easier to manage network access policies across your organization.
