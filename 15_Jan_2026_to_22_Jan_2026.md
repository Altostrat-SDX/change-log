### 🚀 Enhancements

This week, we've focused on giving you more flexibility and making it easier to troubleshoot your automated processes.

*   **More Powerful Custom Emails:** Creating custom emails is now more flexible. You can easily add custom headings, preview text, personalized greetings, and call-to-action buttons to your messages, making your communications more engaging.
*   **Easier Workflow Debugging:** We've made it faster to pinpoint issues in your workflows. When a workflow that processes a list of items fails, you'll now see exactly which specific items caused the error, helping you resolve problems more quickly.
*   **Flexible Realm Setup:** You now have greater flexibility when setting up Realms. They can be created and updated without needing to assign a group upfront, streamlining initial configuration.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **Email Notification Reliability:** We've improved the stability of our email-sending process to ensure your notifications are delivered reliably, even when optional information isn't included.
*   **Realm Search:** We resolved an issue where searching for a Realm by its name would sometimes fail to return the correct results. Searching is now working as expected.
