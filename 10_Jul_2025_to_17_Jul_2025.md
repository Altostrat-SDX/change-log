We're excited to share this week's updates, focusing on delivering a more flexible, reliable, and performant experience for all users. Our latest improvements range from extending user session durations to ensuring more accurate system reporting and overall platform stability.

### Enhancements & Optimizations

*   **Extended User Session Flexibility:** Administrators now have greater control with the maximum allowed session duration for authenticated users significantly increased from 24 hours to 7 days, providing more flexibility in how long users can remain connected.
*   **Smoother Notification Management:** The process for configuring and updating notification groups has been streamlined, making it easier and potentially more responsive to manage your communications.
*   **Flexible Data Access for Dashboards:** Our API for network performance and data usage statistics now supports `GET` requests, offering more versatile options for integrating and fetching your dashboard data.
*   **Improved Device Adoption & Location Management:** We've refined the logic for integrating new devices and managing your allocated locations. This ensures device adoptions consistently update your location count, proactively checks for availability, and prevents unintended overages when re-provisioning existing devices.
*   **Enhanced Administrative Interface:** We've made minor updates to the administrative panel, resulting in small user interface improvements and increased responsiveness for a better management experience.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Reliable Asset Display:** Resolved an issue where instance logos and icons might not load correctly in certain environments, ensuring your branding assets display reliably across all setups.
*   **Consistent Preview Experience:** Ensured that preview URLs for instances are consistently generated, leading to a more reliable and predictable preview experience.
*   **Accurate Usage Reporting:** Corrected issues in our internal processes for synchronizing site usage and tracking VPN user seats, guaranteeing more accurate calculation and reporting against your allocated limits and subscriptions.

### Under the Hood Improvements

*   **Enhanced Platform Stability & Performance:** This week includes numerous updates to core system libraries, frameworks, and underlying dependencies across various services. These significant improvements enhance overall system stability, bolster security, and boost performance, ensuring a more robust and efficient experience.
