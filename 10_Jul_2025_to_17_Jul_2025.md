We're excited to bring you this week's update, packed with powerful new features, significant performance enhancements, and crucial stability improvements designed to make your experience even better. Our teams have been hard at work across various services to deliver more flexibility, deeper insights, and a more robust platform.

### New Features

*   **Empowering Workspaces with New Capabilities:**
    *   Experience a **comprehensive new onboarding process** for smoother sign-ups, including integrated authentication and clear guidance based on subscription status.
    *   Gain **flexible control over organizational resource limits**, allowing you to explicitly set limits as "unlimited" or "denied" to tailor resource allocation precisely.
    *   Benefit from **advanced subscription capacity validation** to prevent under-provisioning, ensuring your subscriptions always meet your current workspace needs.
    *   Enjoy **greater billing transparency** with detailed invoice discounts, clearly showing names and calculated amounts.
    *   Access **enhanced usage reports** with dynamic, user-friendly PDF exports that adapt columns and explanations based on your data.
    *   **Streamlined onboarding for 'Home' account types** now pre-fills demographic and usage fields, simplifying the signup for personal or small-scale use.
*   **Unlocking Deeper Insights with Advanced Audit Logs:**
    *   Discover an **advanced audit log search** that supports comprehensive filtering by date range, user/workspace ID, HTTP method (including exclusions), status code (e.g., `4xx`, `5xx`), API endpoint, IP address, and general search terms.
    *   Get **enriched user context** in your audit logs, including the name and email of the actioning user for easier human-readable analysis.
    *   Leverage **enhanced multi-tenant user activity tracking** for faster, more precise auditing within specific organizations.
    *   Benefit from **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support**, enabling secure integration with client-side applications.
    *   Developers now have **new debug tools** to inspect `response_payload` data processing.

### Enhanced Performance & Stability

*   **Optimized User & Management Experience:**
    *   **Captive Portal sessions can now last up to 7 days**, significantly extending user access periods from the previous 24-hour limit.
    *   **Improved Captive Portal asset and preview link reliability** ensures your branding and previews are always correct and accessible.
    *   **Dashboard data access is more flexible** with API endpoints for throughput and data transferred metrics now supporting both `GET` and `POST` requests.
    *   **Streamlined notification group management** enhances API responsiveness and efficiency, especially for groups with many recipients.
    *   **Expanded MAC Vendor Lookup API** now supports both `GET` and `POST` requests for greater flexibility when querying MAC address information.
    *   **Enhanced site adoption workflows** include more robust pre-checks for location limits, ensuring a smoother experience.
    *   **More accurate VPN user count management** and clearer error messages ensure precise tracking against your subscription limits.
    *   **Workspace resource usage accuracy is significantly improved**, considering usage across your entire organizational hierarchy.
    *   **Robust resource usage management** with atomic updates and comprehensive limit validation ensures reliable and predictable resource allocation.
    *   **Consistent currency handling** throughout the system prevents errors and lays groundwork for future multi-currency support.
    *   **Explicit organization picture clearing** is now fully supported via the API.
*   **Underlying Platform Optimizations:**
    *   **Dramatic audit log query performance boosts** through database-level filtering, intelligent index selection, and enterprise-grade scalability features, ensuring lightning-fast search results even under high load.
    *   **More robust audit log data ingestion** reliably processes complex event messages.
    *   **Optimized logging for audit trails** can optionally skip `GET` requests, reducing log volume.
    *   **Improved API response transparency** for audit logs now includes query execution details and warnings.
    *   **Clearer audit log API response formatting** with intuitive field names improves readability.
    *   **Enhanced internal site count synchronization** provides more precise reporting.
    *   **Improved system observability** with more detailed health check endpoints for administrators.
    *   **Foundational system updates** across numerous services deliver general improvements to performance, stability, and security through updated core libraries and dependencies.

### Key Bug Fixes

*   **Workspaces:**
    *   **Tightened CORS configurations** for enhanced security, restricting API access to specific paths.
*   **VPN:**
    *   **Corrected user seat allocation** ensures accurate user counts when adding more than the initially included users to your VPN instance.
*   **Site Management:**
    *   **Resolved an issue where re-adopting a device could incorrectly increment total location usage**, now accurately reflecting only new device additions.
*   **Audit Logs:**
    *   **Fixed date range filtering inaccuracies** for organization logs, ensuring precise time-based results.
    *   **Corrected internal logic for KSUID timestamp extraction**, enhancing data integrity.
*   **General Stability:**
    *   Incorporated **various bug fixes and stability improvements** through updated underlying dependencies across the platform.
