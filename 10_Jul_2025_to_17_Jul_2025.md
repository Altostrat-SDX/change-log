### üéâ What's New

*   **Advanced Audit Log Insights:** Gain deeper visibility into your organization's activity with powerful new filtering options. You can now quickly filter audit logs by HTTP status code categories (e.g., successes, client errors, server errors), specific HTTP methods (e.g., `POST`, `DELETE`, or even exclude `GET` requests), and easily track activity for individual users within your organization. Each log entry now includes richer context with user display names and email addresses.
*   **Streamlined User Onboarding:** We've introduced a more robust and automated onboarding process for new users, ensuring a smooth start with automatic workspace and billing setup. For users with "home" account types, initial setup details are now pre-filled for even greater convenience.
*   **Proactive Subscription Health Checks:** A new system checks your subscription and billing status *before* you access services, providing timely alerts and guiding you to resolve any billing issues efficiently, ensuring uninterrupted service.

### ‚ú® Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Expanded Customization & Flexibility:**
    *   **Captive Portal Flexibility:** Enjoy significantly extended maximum session durations for captive portal users, increasing from 24 hours to a full 7 days.
    *   **Smarter Notification Management:** Our API for managing notification groups is now more flexible, making it easier to set up and manage recipients.
    *   **Versatile Data Retrieval:** Dashboard endpoints for throughput and data transfer now support both `GET` and `POST` requests, offering greater integration flexibility.
    *   **Flexible MAC Vendor Lookups:** The MAC address vendor lookup API now supports both `GET` and `POST` requests for bulk queries.
*   **Enhanced Workspace Management:**
    *   **Granular Resource Limits:** You now have more precise control over organization resource limits, with clear options to set specific numbers, deny usage (`0`), or inherit from parent organizations. The system provides improved validation and clearer error messages to guide you.
    *   **Dynamic Usage Reports:** PDF exports of organization usage reports are now more concise and relevant, dynamically adjusting content based on explicit limits or child organizations.
    *   **Improved Billing Transparency:** Invoice details now include more comprehensive information about applied discounts, providing greater clarity.
    *   **Robust Currency Handling:** We've laid the groundwork for future multi-currency support with more robust and type-safe currency handling, preventing errors during subscription creation.
*   **Significant Performance & Usability Boosts:**
    *   **Lightning-Fast Audit Log Queries:** We've drastically optimized audit log searches, leading to up to 95% faster filtered results and more efficient date range queries. API responses now offer valuable performance metrics and warnings to help you optimize your searches.
    *   **Resilient Log Processing:** The system for processing audit log events is now more robust, ensuring reliable data ingestion even under high load, and intelligently skips non-essential requests to optimize storage.
    *   **Improved API Interactions:** We've standardized API responses to JSON and enhanced CORS support for better integration across various applications.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

*   **Reliable Licensing & Billing:**
    *   Resolved an issue where re-registering an existing device could incorrectly consume an additional license seat. Now, existing devices can re-register without affecting your current license usage.
    *   Corrected an issue with VPN peer seat usage reporting to ensure accurate billing, especially around minimum peer counts.
    *   Enhanced error messages for VPN instance deletion failures, providing clearer feedback for API consumers.
*   **Consistent Data & Access:**
    *   Fixed an issue where custom assets like logos and icons might not load correctly on Captive Portal pages.
    *   Ensured Captive Portal instance preview URLs consistently point to the production domain for reliable testing.
    *   Resolved a routing issue that prevented consistent access to the `/dashboard/data-transferred` endpoint via `GET` requests.
    *   Addressed a calculation error in organization usage summaries to ensure "available capacity" correctly accounts for total usage, including child organizations.
    *   Prevented attempts to reduce resource usage below zero, providing clear error messages for such actions.
    *   Fixed an issue where explicitly clearing an organization's profile picture might not have been processed correctly.
    *   Resolved an issue that caused inaccurate date range queries in audit logs. All time-based queries are now reliable.
*   **Enhanced Security:**
    *   Tightened API security by restricting CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) access to specific `/workspaces/*` API paths, limiting unauthorized access.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Platform Stability & Performance

*   **Continuous Platform Health:** We've rolled out extensive updates across our core platform infrastructure, including underlying frameworks and dependencies. These behind-the-scenes improvements enhance the overall stability, security, and performance of numerous services, ensuring a more robust and reliable experience. This foundational work also prepares our systems for future features and optimizations.
