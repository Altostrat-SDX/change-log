We've been busy this week releasing several updates focused on improving performance, stability, and your overall experience. Here's a summary of the key changes from February 13th to February 20th:

## Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Faster Report Loading:** Experience significantly quicker load times when viewing your generated reports, especially if you have many. Report sorting and pagination are now more consistent and accurate across all pages.
*   **Optimized Scan History:** Scan history results are now sorted with the most recent scans appearing first, making it easier to find the information you need quickly. We also implemented checks to ensure system reliability during long-running scan tasks.
*   **Reliable Network Configurations:** Made improvements to ensure network firewall rules are updated more reliably when adding or removing network connections, ensuring correct traffic handling.
*   **Clearer Connection Status:** Enhanced error messages when fetching network connection details if the required connection tunnel is offline, providing better insight into the connection status.
*   **Corrected Email Links:** Updated links in several important email notifications (including Network Alerts, VPN Credentials, and scan notifications) to ensure they guide you to the correct destination.
*   **Quicker Script Listing:** Speed up the loading time when viewing lists of your scheduled scripts.
*   **Performance Report Optimization:** Optimized background processing for performance reports.
*   Made internal platform updates for enhanced stability and consistency.

## Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue that could prevent the initial device setup process from completing correctly on connected devices.
*   Fixed a problem that was preventing configuration backups from being uploaded successfully.

These updates reflect our ongoing commitment to providing a reliable, performant, and easy-to-use platform.
