### Weekly Summary (May 8 - May 15, 2025)

This week brings a host of updates across the platform, including a new notification channel, significant enhancements to team management and security, improvements to billing and login flows, API updates, and a continued focus on platform stability and performance.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Enhanced Team Management:** Introducing comprehensive tools to manage your team members, including adding, inviting, deleting, and updating their roles. You can now also define and manage custom team roles with specific permissions.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication Control:** Users now have dedicated tools to manage their Multi-Factor Authentication settings, including enabling MFA, regenerating recovery codes, and removing the feature if needed.
*   **Improved Login Flow:** We've rolled out a dedicated login service that supports directing users to authentication with specific organizational context and return URLs, plus it can remember your chosen organization for easier access.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Improved Notification Recipient Validation:** We've enhanced the validation process when creating or updating notification groups. The system now better ensures that specified recipients correspond to active users, leading to more accurate group management.
*   **API Recipient Accuracy:** When retrieving notification groups via the API, the list of recipients is now validated against the user directory, filtering out any invalid or inactive entries to ensure you receive the most accurate data.
*   **Logs API Authentication Update:** The authentication mechanism for the logs API has been updated for enhanced security and consistency. If you are a consumer of the logs API, please review the latest documentation as you may need to update your authentication method.
*   **Smoother Team Member Listing:** Listing large numbers of team members is now more efficient thanks to pagination support.
*   **Richer Information:** User and team-related details provided by the system are now more comprehensive, giving you access to more relevant information.
*   **Enhanced Security & Validation:** We've strengthened access controls for managing team resources and added more robust data validation across several services, including billing and incoming SMS.
*   **Improved Billing Experience:** Error handling within the billing process is now more graceful, guiding users to informative error pages when issues occur. Users who are already logged in will also experience smoother navigation, bypassing the login page automatically.
*   **Consistent Data:** Team role names created via the API are now automatically formatted for better consistency.

### Stability and Performance

*   **Widespread Internal Updates:** Across various services, we've deployed significant updates to underlying system libraries, dependencies, and internal components. While not introducing new user-facing features, these updates are crucial for improving the overall stability, security, reliability, and performance of the platform.
*   **General Platform Stability & Performance:** General internal improvements have been made to enhance the overall stability, security, and performance of the platform (covered by the point above, but acknowledging both original entries).

### üêû Bug Fixes

*   Resolved issues where user details were incorrectly reporting Multi-Factor Authentication status.
*   Fixed a problem where the user details display was showing an incorrect status regarding whether a user was allowed to log in.

Stay tuned for more updates next week!
