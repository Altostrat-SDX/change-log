This week empowers administrators with robust team management and security controls, while delivering significant platform stability improvements across all services.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Comprehensive Team Management**: Complete toolkit for managing team members—add, invite, delete, update roles. Define custom roles with specific permissions. Essential for MSPs managing technician access across multiple client networks.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Control**: Users can now manage their own MFA settings—enable MFA, regenerate recovery codes, or remove MFA. Critical for compliance with security frameworks (SOC 2, ISO 27001).
- **Enhanced Login Service**: Dedicated authentication service supports organizational context and return URLs, with organization memory for faster access. Streamlines SSO workflows and multi-tenant access.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Improved Notification Validation**: Enhanced validation when creating/updating notification groups ensures recipients correspond to active users—prevents alert delivery failures.
- **API Recipient Accuracy**: Notification group API responses now filter out invalid/inactive recipients—ensures accurate data for automation and integrations.

- **Paginated Team Listing**: Efficiently handle large team member lists with pagination support.
- **Richer User Details**: More comprehensive user and team information in API responses.
- **Strengthened Access Controls**: Enhanced authorization for team resource management with robust data validation across billing and SMS services.
- **Improved Billing UX**: Graceful error handling guides users to informative pages. Logged-in users bypass login page automatically.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Team role names auto-formatted for consistency via API.
- **Platform Stability**: Extensive updates to system libraries and dependencies improve overall stability, security, and performance.
