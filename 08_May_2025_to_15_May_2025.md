### This Week's Updates (May 8th - May 15th)

We've been busy enhancing the platform with new capabilities, improvements, and fixes to provide a better experience for you!

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Enhanced Team Management:** Introducing comprehensive tools to manage your team members, including adding, inviting, deleting, and updating their roles. You can now also define and manage custom team roles with specific permissions.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication Control:** Users now have dedicated tools to manage their Multi-Factor Authentication settings, including enabling MFA, regenerating recovery codes, and removing the feature if needed.
*   **Geographic Data Access:** Added the ability to retrieve lists of country codes and timezones, useful for various applications.
*   **Improved Login Flow:** We've rolled out a dedicated login service that supports directing users to authentication with specific organizational context and return URLs, plus it can remember your chosen organization for easier access.
*   **Incoming SMS Capability:** A new endpoint is available to receive and process incoming SMS messages, allowing integration with other systems.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Smoother Team Member Listing:** Listing large numbers of team members is now more efficient thanks to pagination support.
*   **Richer Information:** User and team-related details provided by the system are now more comprehensive, giving you access to more relevant information.
*   **Enhanced Security & Validation:** We've strengthened access controls for managing team resources and added more robust data validation across several services, including billing and incoming SMS.
*   **Improved Billing Experience:** Error handling within the billing process is now more graceful, guiding users to informative error pages when issues occur. Users who are already logged in will also experience smoother navigation, bypassing the login page automatically.
*   **Consistent Data:** Team role names created via the API are now automatically formatted for better consistency.
*   **Platform Stability & Performance:** General internal improvements have been made to enhance the overall stability, security, and performance of the platform.

### üêû Bug Fixes
