### Weekly Summary (May 8 - May 15, 2025)

This week's updates include a valuable new option for notifications and continued focus on enhancing the stability and performance of the platform through essential internal maintenance.

### New Features

*   **WhatsApp Notification Channel:** You can now specify WhatsApp as a notification channel when configuring notifications for groups, providing an additional way to receive important alerts.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Notification Recipient Validation:** We've enhanced the validation process when creating or updating notification groups. The system now better ensures that specified recipients correspond to active users, leading to more accurate group management.
*   **API Recipient Accuracy:** When retrieving notification groups via the API, the list of recipients is now validated against the user directory, filtering out any invalid or inactive entries to ensure you receive the most accurate data.
*   **Logs API Authentication Update:** The authentication mechanism for the logs API has been updated for enhanced security and consistency. If you are a consumer of the logs API, please review the latest documentation as you may need to update your authentication method.

### Stability and Performance

*   **Widespread Internal Updates:** Across various services, we've deployed significant updates to underlying system libraries, dependencies, and internal components. While not introducing new user-facing features, these updates are crucial for improving the overall stability, security, reliability, and performance of the platform.

This week's releases lay the groundwork for future improvements and ensure the platform remains robust and efficient.
