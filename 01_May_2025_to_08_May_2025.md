### Highlights from May 1st to May 8th, 2025

We're excited to share the latest updates rolled out this week, bringing a new feature and significant under-the-hood improvements to enhance your experience and the overall stability of the platform.

### New Features

*   **Expanded Authentication Options:** For administrators configuring secure access, we've added support for using **Auth0** as a new Identity Provider option for captive portal instances. This provides greater flexibility in managing user authentication using the OAuth2 strategy.

### Enhancements & Stability Improvements

This week's updates included extensive work on the foundation of our services to ensure a more reliable and efficient experience.

*   **Core System Updates:** We performed significant updates to underlying libraries, dependencies, and core system components across many services. These updates incorporate the latest stability fixes, performance optimizations, and security enhancements from the frameworks and packages we utilize.
*   **Improved Reliability and Performance:** The comprehensive updates contribute to overall system stability, improved performance, and increased reliability across the platform's various functions, including reporting, metrics, data processing, and more.
*   **Admin Panel Refinements:** Minor updates were applied to the administrative interface to enhance stability within the management dashboard.

These updates are part of our ongoing commitment to providing a robust, secure, and high-performing platform.
