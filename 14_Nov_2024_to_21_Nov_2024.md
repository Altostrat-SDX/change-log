### Weekly Summary (Nov 14 - Nov 21)

This period marked the introduction of our foundational security vulnerability scanning capabilities. While no other major user-facing features were deployed, significant progress was made in expanding our security services.

### New Service Activations & Initial Features

*   **CVE Vulnerability Scanning (`cve-scans`):** The `cve-scans` service is now online! This service provides the core functionality for managing and scheduling CVE vulnerability scans. Initial capabilities include defining scan schedules and initiating scans (via `mikrotik`/`scripts`). Report generation to S3 (using `pdf-generator`) and basic notification dispatch (via `messenger`) are also established.
*   **CVE Scan Data ETL (`cve-scans-etl`):** Complementing the scanning service, `cve-scans-etl` has been activated. This ETL pipeline is responsible for processing raw scan results, enriching data with MAC vendor info, service names (via `control-plane`), and performing initial CVE lookups against Vulners/MITRE. Enriched data is stored in S3.

**Platform Focus:**

For the period of November 14th to November 21st, 2024, beyond the launch of the CVE services, there were no new general features, enhancements, or bug fixes deployed across other services. Our teams continue to work on upcoming improvements and further developing the capabilities of newly activated services.
