This week delivers a major upgrade to the SLA reporting engine, empowering you with sophisticated tag-based automation that scales with your network. Combined with dashboard accuracy improvements and enhanced vulnerability scanning, these updates help you manage distributed MikroTik networks more effectively.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Dynamic Tag-Based SLA Report Scheduling:** Create intelligent report schedules that automatically include sites based on tag-matching rules. As your network grows and sites are added with matching tags, they're automatically incorporated into scheduled reports without manual updates. Perfect for MSPs managing multiple customer networks or enterprises with dynamic network topologies.
- **Site Grouping by Tags in Reports:** Organize sites within SLA reports by specific tag dimensions such as `Region`, `Customer`, or `Priority` to view aggregated performance metrics for each logical group. This capability enables sophisticated multi-tenant reporting and hierarchical performance tracking.
- **Redundancy Health Calculation for High-Availability:** A new SLA aggregation method considers a group of sites "online" if at least one site within the group is operational. This is essential for accurately reporting uptime on high-availability clusters, redundant VPN hubs, and other fault-tolerant network architectures.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Rebuilt Report Scheduling Infrastructure:** We've completely redesigned the scheduled SLA reporting system from the ground up, delivering significantly improved reliability and scalability. This ensures your network performance reports are generated and delivered consistently, even as your MikroTik fleet expands.
- **Enhanced Dashboard Graph Accuracy:** Dashboard visualizations now display more accurate data, especially when zooming in on specific time windows. We've implemented smarter query calculations that adapt based on the selected time range, ensuring precision whether you're viewing hourly trends or multi-day patterns.
- **More Robust Vulnerability Scanning:** Vulnerability scans for your MikroTik fleet are now more resilient when operating on large networks or sites with slower connectivity. We've optimized the AI-powered scan summary generation for better performance and made scan schedule management significantly faster.
- **Enhanced Scan Security:** Vulnerability scan schedule details now respect user permissions more strictly, displaying only sites that you're authorized to view within your organizational hierarchy.
- **Richer Managed VPN API Data:** Developer integrations can now access the `username` field in API responses for Managed VPN tunnel resources, providing an additional useful identifier for automation and monitoring integrations.
- **Optimized Performance Metrics Collection:** We've streamlined how the platform collects device performance statistics (CPU utilization, memory usage, uptime) from your MikroTik routers, improving overall platform responsiveness and reducing overhead.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Legacy Report Schedule Compatibility:** Resolved an issue to ensure that older SLA report schedules, created before tag-based site selection was introduced, continue functioning perfectly without requiring migration.
- **Dashboard Query Reliability:** Fixed a bug that could cause graph queries to fail when zooming in very closely on specific time ranges in dashboard panels.
- **Scan Control Reliability:** Eliminated a rare edge case that could prevent an in-progress vulnerability scan from being stopped via the platform interface.
