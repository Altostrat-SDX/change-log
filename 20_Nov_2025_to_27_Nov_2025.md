This week, we're excited to roll out a major upgrade to our reporting engine, giving you powerful new ways to organize and schedule reports. We've also shipped key improvements to dashboard accuracy, scan reliability, and overall platform performance.

### 🚀 New Features

*   **Dynamic Report Scheduling with Tags:** You can now create report schedules that automatically include sites based on their tags. This is perfect for generating reports that adapt as your infrastructure changes, without needing manual updates.
*   **Group Report Data by Tags:** Organize sites within your reports by a specific tag, such as "Region" or "Customer," to see aggregated results for each group.
*   **New "Redundancy" Health Check for Grouped Sites:** A new aggregation option for grouped sites considers the group "online" if at least one site within it is active. This is ideal for accurately reporting on high-availability and clustered environments.

### ✨ Enhancements

*   **Reporting:** We've completely overhauled our scheduled reporting system, making it significantly more reliable and scalable to ensure your reports are generated on time, every time.
*   **Dashboards & Visualizations:** Graphs on your dashboards are now more accurate, especially when you zoom in on specific time ranges, thanks to smarter query calculations.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scans are now more robust on large or slow networks. We've also improved the performance of AI-powered scan summaries and made it faster to manage your scan schedules.
*   **Security:** For added security, scan schedule details will now only display the sites that you have permission to view.
*   **API:** Developers can now find the `username` field in the API response for tunnel resources, providing an additional useful identifier.
*   **Performance:** We've optimized how we collect device performance statistics (like CPU and memory), which improves overall platform speed and efficiency.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **Reporting:** Resolved an issue to ensure older report schedules, created before tag-based selection was available, continue to work flawlessly.
*   **Dashboards:** Fixed a bug that could cause graph queries to fail when zooming in closely on a dashboard.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Squashed a rare bug that could prevent a scan from being stopped while it was in progress.
