### Platform Go-Live! (Oct 24, 2024)

This week represents a significant milestone with the successful activation of the Altostrat SDX Platform. Our distributed microservice architecture is now mostly operational.

**Core Infrastructure & Management Services Now Online:**

*   **Authentication & Authorization (`auth`):** The central Identity Provider (IdP) is live, managing users, organizations, teams, API tokens, and initial billing integration stubs. Secure JWT-based authentication is now enforced across the platform.
*   **Device & Network Control (`control-plane`, `mikrotik`):** Foundation for site and tunnel lifecycle management is active. The `mikrotik` service enables basic device adoption, heartbeats, status tracking, and a command job queue.
*   **Metadata Services (`metadata`):** Centralized key-value metadata storage (DynamoDB) and site-specific file storage (S3 for notes, documents) are operational, providing crucial context for all services.
*   **Notification Backbone (`messenger`):** The core notification dispatch service is active, ready to route alerts via WhatsApp, Email, and Ably (WebSockets) as other services begin generating events.
*   **Utility Services Activated:**
    *   **PDF Generation (`pdf-generator`):** The utility service for creating PDF documents from various inputs is now available for other services to utilize.
    *   **AI Language Model Gateway (`ai-llm`):** A secure proxy to OpenAI services is online, prepared for integration with features requiring AI capabilities.
    *   **Scheduling Engine (`schedules`):** The `schedules` service is operational, providing an API for managing time-based schedules (e.g., Business Hours) and publishing status changes.

**Networking & Connectivity Services Launched:**

*   **Client VPN (`vpn`):** Initial capabilities for provisioning and managing client VPN infrastructure (WireGuard/OpenVPN on Vultr) are now active, including basic peer connection management and DNS integration.
*   **WAN Failover (`wan-failover`):** The service for managing OpenVPN-based WAN failover tunnels for sites is online, with core functionality for tunnel creation and status monitoring enabled.
*   **Static IP Management (`elastic-ip`):** Foundational service for static IP allocation and RADIUS user credential management is now available.

**Monitoring & Reporting Foundations Established:**

*   **Metrics Collection (`metrics`):** The `metrics` service is now ingesting initial network metrics (SNMP, Ping, Syslog stubs) and providing basic query APIs.
*   **Log Aggregation (`logs`):** The `logs` service provides an API interface to query logs stored in AWS CloudWatch, making centralized log access possible.
*   **Fault Management (`faults`):** The central repository for fault events is active, capable of ingesting faults via SNS and offering query APIs.

This comprehensive internal launch lays the groundwork for all subsequent feature rollouts and enhancements. The focus in the coming weeks will be on activating specific functionalities within these services and refining their operations.
