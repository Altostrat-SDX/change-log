We're excited to bring you the latest updates from our development teams, focusing on enhancing stability, reliability, and performance across the platform.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Increased Reliability for Reports and Notifications:** We've implemented better retry mechanisms for data collection during report generation and added rate limiting for outbound emails, making your reports more complete and ensuring notifications are delivered more consistently.
*   **Improved System Stability and Performance:** Several core services received significant underlying platform upgrades, including updates to frameworks and programming languages. These changes lay a stronger foundation for future development and provide general performance boosts and increased stability.
*   **Smoother Configuration Processes:** Enhancements were made to improve the reliability of fetching necessary network information during device configuration setups.
*   **Updated Administrative Panel:** Users of the administrative panel will notice user interface changes resulting from an upgrade to a newer version of the panel framework.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Resolved Device Status Issue:** We fixed an issue that could prevent device heartbeat data from being processed correctly under certain conditions. This resolves potential inaccuracies in device online/offline status and displayed information.

This week's updates pave the way for a more robust and reliable experience. Stay tuned for more improvements!
