### Highlights

This week, we focused on boosting performance, improving data accuracy, and enhancing the reliability of core processes.

### Performance & Reliability Enhancements

*   Experience faster loading times and smoother interactions when viewing lists, such as site lists and SLA report schedules, thanks to optimized caching.
*   General performance and responsiveness have been improved across the platform.
*   Scan processing is now more reliable with enhanced detection of stuck scans and improved termination processes.
*   Data collection for metrics from sites with offline connections has been refined, leading to greater system reliability.
*   Internal processes for sending scheduled script authorization requests have been adjusted for better reliability.

### Data Accuracy & Usability Improvements

*   Backup lists and individual file views now accurately display the actual creation time of backup files, and lists are sorted more reliably by this time.
*   Email notifications have received a visual refresh with updated branding, sender information, and corrected links.
*   The visual style of PDF headers has been updated, and links within generated reports (like CVE reports) now point to the correct destinations.
*   Site adoption via runbook now correctly enforces account seat limits.

### Key Bug Fixes

*   Critical issues in site provisioning automation have been resolved, ensuring that essential steps like assigning network addresses and applying policies are correctly completed when new sites are created.
*   Corrected timezone handling and improved data point filling for Ping Stats graphs, ensuring more accurate and complete visualizations.
*   Fixed issues that could prevent scans from finalizing or being correctly processed under certain conditions.
*   Resolved problems that could occur during the deletion of connections if related site information was missing.
*   Addressed an issue where the list of recently accessed sites might not refresh properly for all users.
*   Fixed an error where certain internal lines were incorrectly included in the list of detected network subnets from configuration backups.
*   Corrected instances where links in email notifications or generated reports pointed to old or incorrect locations.
*   Resolved an issue preventing the correct display of the number of sites in scheduled script authorization request notifications.
*   Implemented a check to prevent sites from being unintentionally assigned a second network address.
