This week focuses on performance and accuracy: dramatically faster list loading, precise Configuration Backup timestamps, and critical fixes ensuring reliable site provisioning automation.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Accelerated List Loading**: Optimized caching delivers faster loading for site lists and SLA report schedules—especially noticeable for MSPs managing dozens of clients.
- **Platform Performance**: General responsiveness improvements across the platform.
- **Reliable Vulnerability Scanning**: Enhanced stuck scan detection and improved termination processes prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Resilient Metrics Collection**: Refined data collection for sites with offline connections improves overall system reliability.
- **Enhanced Script Authorization**: Improved reliability for scheduled script authorization request delivery.
- **Accurate Configuration Backup Timestamps**: Backup lists and file views now display actual creation time with reliable sorting—critical for compliance audits and disaster recovery.
- **Refreshed Notifications & Reports**: Updated email branding, sender information, and corrected links. Refreshed PDF header styling with accurate CVE report links.
- **Enforced License Limits**: Site adoption via runbook now correctly enforces account seat limits—prevents accidental license overages.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Site Provisioning Automation** (Critical): Resolved issues in automated provisioning ensuring essential steps complete correctly—network address assignment, firewall policy application—when new sites are created. Critical for reliable device onboarding.
- **WAN Ping Statistics**: Corrected timezone handling and improved data point filling for accurate graph visualization
- **Vulnerability Scan Processing**: Fixed scan finalization and processing failures under specific conditions
- **Managed VPN Deletion**: Resolved connection deletion failures when site information missing
- **Recent Sites Refresh**: Fixed recent site list not updating properly for all users
- **Backup Subnet Parsing**: Removed incorrect internal configuration lines from detected subnet lists in Configuration Backups
- **Email & Report Links**: Corrected links in notifications and generated reports pointing to outdated locations
- **Script Authorization Counts**: Fixed incorrect site count display in script authorization notifications
- **Duplicate Network Assignments**: Implemented check preventing sites from receiving duplicate management IP addresses
