This week, we've focused on bringing you a new feature, enhancing the stability and reliability of various platform components, and squashing some bugs.

### Highlights

*   **New API for Network Device Grouping:** We've introduced new API endpoints that allow you to create, view, update, and delete ARP groups, making it easier to organize your network devices within a site.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Increased Data Collection Reliability:** Improved the process of collecting data from network devices, adding better handling for timeouts and errors. This enhancement boosts the reliability of getting information like SNMP data and WAN tunnel performance statistics, especially from less responsive devices.
*   **API Stability:** Various API endpoints received minor stability enhancements, including better checks for missing data and refined error handling.
*   **Faster Scan Results Access:** Your scan lists are now automatically sorted by the most recent scans, helping you find the latest results more quickly.
*   **Improved Scan System Stability:** Added automated monitoring to detect and terminate vulnerability scans that might get stuck, enhancing the overall stability of the scanning service.
*   **Clearer Error Messages:** Interactions with core management processes now provide more specific feedback when connection failures occur during operations like data synchronization or managing network rules.
*   **More Reliable Automatic DNS Updates:** Enhanced the reliability of automatic DNS updates for your sites, reducing potential issues when device IP addresses change.
*   **Refined Captive Portal Configuration:** Improved the validation process when updating site and subnet associations for Captive Portal instances via the API.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Resolved Captive Portal Site Removal:** Fixed an issue that previously prevented the successful removal of the last site associated with a Captive Portal instance.
*   **Corrected Network Device Record Deletion:** Addressed a bug that prevented the correct deletion of associated network device records (like ARP entries) when a site was removed from the platform.
*   **Fixed Performance Data Formatting:** Resolved a potential issue that could occur when formatting WAN tunnel performance statistics in API responses under specific conditions.
*   **Improved Message Sending Reliability:** Addressed an issue where message sending jobs (for notifications) could fail or retry excessively when external services encountered temporary errors. The system now handles these external issues more gracefully.
