This week delivers better network organization tools, significantly more reliable data collection from your MikroTik fleet, and enhanced vulnerability scanning stability.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Network Device Grouping API**: New endpoints for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting ARP groups—organize network devices within sites for clearer inventory management and reporting. Essential for MSPs segmenting client networks by department or location.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Dramatically Improved Data Collection Reliability**: Enhanced error handling and timeout management for SNMP data collection and WAN tunnel performance statistics—especially important for devices with intermittent connectivity or high latency. Ensures more complete monitoring data.
- **Enhanced API Stability**: Improved error handling and missing data checks across multiple endpoints.
- **Optimized Scan Access**: Vulnerability scan lists now automatically sorted by most recent first—faster access to latest security assessments.
- **Automated Scan Monitoring**: New watchdog system detects and terminates stuck vulnerability scans—prevents resource exhaustion and ensures scanning service stability.
- **Clearer Error Messages**: More specific feedback during device connection failures for data synchronization and firewall rule management—accelerates troubleshooting.
- **Reliable Automatic DNS Updates**: Enhanced Dynamic DNS update reliability when device IP addresses change—maintains stable remote access.
- **Refined Captive Portal Validation**: Improved site and subnet association validation during API configuration updates.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Fixed inability to remove final site from Captive Portal instance
- Corrected ARP entry cleanup when sites are deleted from platform
- Resolved WAN tunnel performance data formatting issues in API responses
- Improved notification delivery resilience when external services experience temporary errors
