This week, we‚Äôre excited to introduce powerful new capabilities for automation, expand our global infrastructure, and deliver significant performance and reliability improvements across the platform.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Powerful Scripting with Loops:** You can now dynamically generate script commands by looping over lists of data. The new `@foreach` syntax makes it easy to manage multiple firewall rules, network prefixes, or any other list-based configuration from a single, powerful script template.
*   **New Developer and Admin Tools:** We've added several new tools and API endpoints to give you more control and insight:
    *   **Subscription Status API:** A new endpoint is available to programmatically check if an organization has an active subscription or is in a trial period.
    *   **Chat History Exporter:** A new command-line utility allows administrators to extract and analyze conversation histories in JSON, CSV, or plain text formats.
    *   **Resource Management Commands:** New admin commands are available to manually unlock security groups or prefix lists that may become stuck during an update.

### üöÄ Enhancements & Performance

*   **Expanded Service to Asia-Pacific:** We've launched a new service region in Australia to provide a faster, lower-latency experience for all our users in the area.
*   **Faster API and Dashboard Performance:** We've rolled out significant speed improvements across the platform. You'll notice faster loading times for dashboards, metadata, and tags, thanks to optimized data fetching and caching. We've also enhanced our serverless infrastructure for quicker API responses overall.
*   **Smarter Security Rule Management:** We've made our security configuration system more intelligent and reliable. Changes to Prefix Lists now automatically and consistently update any Security Groups that use them. We've also improved how the system handles resource updates to prevent conflicts and ensure changes are applied smoothly.
*   **More Accurate Alerts:** Site reboot notifications are now more precise, reducing false alerts that could be caused by brief network interruptions.
*   **Greater Scripting Flexibility:** When writing scripts, you no longer need to use every variable you define, giving you more flexibility for creating templates with optional values.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

*   **API & Integration:** Resolved issues that could prevent some API tools from accessing the full list of workspaces or connecting to the Radius service.
*   **Reliability:** Fixed a bug that could occasionally generate invalid or expired links for file downloads. We also fixed an issue that could cause updates to security groups to fail if multiple changes were made simultaneously.
*   **Scripting:** Corrected an error that could occur when using array variables in scripts, ensuring they work seamlessly with the new loop feature.
*   **Firewall Configuration:** Ensured that firewall rules are generated with the correct `accept` action and that rules for protocols without ports (like ICMP) are handled properly.
*   **General:** Fixed minor issues with the new subscription status endpoint and ensured that API clients can reliably access all workspace information.
