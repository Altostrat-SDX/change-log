This week delivers powerful new automation capabilities, expands the SDX platform's global infrastructure reach, and implements significant performance and reliability improvements for managing distributed MikroTik networks at scale.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Dynamic Script Loops with @foreach:** Transform your RouterOS script management with the new `@foreach` syntax that enables dynamic command generation by iterating over data lists. This powerful capability simplifies managing repetitive configurations like multiple firewall rules, BGP prefix lists, or VLAN assignments from a single, maintainable script template. Perfect for deploying consistent configurations across your entire MikroTik fleet.
- **Enhanced Developer & Administrative Tools:**
  - **Subscription Status API:** Verify organization subscription status programmatically to build automated customer lifecycle workflows and billing integrations.
  - **Chat History Export Utility:** New command-line tool enables administrators to extract and analyze AI Co-pilot conversation histories in JSON, CSV, or plain text formats for auditing, training, or troubleshooting purposes.
  - **Manual Resource Recovery Commands:** Administrative commands are now available to manually unlock Security Groups or Prefix Lists that may become stuck during synchronization, providing direct control during edge-case scenarios.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Asia-Pacific Service Expansion:** Launched a new service region in Australia, providing lower latency and faster response times for Management VPN connections, API operations, and platform interactions for users throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This expansion improves the experience of managing MikroTik networks across diverse geographic locations.
- **Substantially Faster Platform Performance:** Rolled out comprehensive performance optimizations delivering noticeably faster API responses and dashboard load times. Enhanced caching strategies and optimized data fetching improve the speed of retrieving site metadata, tags, and dashboard panels. Serverless infrastructure improvements reduce cold-start times for all API operations.
- **Intelligent Security Policy Management:** Enhanced the Security Groups and Prefix Lists system with smarter synchronization logic. Changes to Prefix Lists now automatically and consistently trigger updates to dependent Security Groups, ensuring firewall rules always reflect the latest IP address definitions. Improved conflict resolution prevents race conditions when multiple administrators make simultaneous changes.
- **More Accurate Reboot Detection:** Refined site reboot detection algorithms to reduce false-positive notifications caused by brief network interruptions or device connectivity issues, ensuring alerts genuinely represent device reboot events.
- **Flexible Script Variable Handling:** Script templates are now more flexible—you can define variables without necessarily using them all, simplifying template management for scripts with optional or conditional configurations.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **API Integration Reliability:** Resolved issues preventing certain API integrations from accessing the complete workspace list or connecting to RADIUS authentication services.
- **Download Link Stability:** Fixed a bug that could intermittently generate invalid or expired links for Configuration Backup downloads and other file exports.
- **Security Group Update Concurrency:** Eliminated an issue that could cause Security Group updates to fail when multiple changes were made simultaneously from different sessions.
- **Script Array Variable Handling:** Corrected an error in script processing when using array variables, ensuring seamless integration with the new `@foreach` loop functionality.
- **Firewall Rule Generation:** Ensured firewall rules are generated with correct action directives (`accept`) and properly handle protocols without port specifications (like ICMP, IGMP).
- **Workspace API Consistency:** Fixed minor issues with the subscription status endpoint and ensured API clients can reliably access all workspace information across different authentication contexts.
