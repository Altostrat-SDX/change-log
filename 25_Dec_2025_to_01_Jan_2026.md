### ✨ Happy Holidays! ✨

Our teams took some well-deserved time off this past week to rest, recharge, and celebrate the holiday season.

As a result, there are no new features or bug fixes to report for this period. We'll be back next week with our regularly scheduled updates.

We wish you all a wonderful and prosperous new year!
