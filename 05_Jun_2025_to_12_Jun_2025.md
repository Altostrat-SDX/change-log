Hello and welcome to our weekly changelog summary! This week, we're excited to introduce new ways to view your network performance data, alongside significant improvements to data consistency and several important bug fixes to enhance your overall experience.

## New Features

*   **Aggregated Network Performance Data:** Gain better visibility into your network's performance with new capabilities to retrieve aggregated throughput and data transfer volume across your sites. You can now easily query this data for specific time ranges and filter by site.

## Enhancements

*   **Improved Data Consistency:** We've made significant progress in standardizing date and time formats across various API responses throughout the platform. Timestamps for reports, security scan data, transient access logs, job statuses, fault events, and backup details now consistently use the standard ISO 8601 format, making data integration and parsing easier for everyone.
*   **Enhanced Performance & Stability:** We've increased system resources and updated underlying dependencies to improve overall service performance, stability, and security.
*   **Expanded Site Information:** The minimal site list API now includes the device serial number, making it easier to identify and manage sites, especially in user interfaces.

## Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue that could prevent the correct parsing and display of scan start and finish times in security scan API responses.
*   Corrected a fault reporting issue to ensure that unresolved faults now correctly return a `null` value for the resolution timestamp in API responses.

We hope these updates further improve your experience with our services. Stay tuned for more next week!
