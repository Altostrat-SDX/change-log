This week delivers essential tools for network monitoring and reporting: aggregated performance metrics for fleet-wide visibility, standardized data formats for easier integration, and enhanced system stability.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Aggregated Network Performance APIs**: New endpoints provide comprehensive fleet analytics:
  - **Network Throughput**: Retrieve aggregated throughput (bps) across all sites or specific site groups with flexible time windows and intervals—perfect for capacity planning and NOC dashboards
  - **Total Data Transferred**: Access aggregate data transfer volume (bytes) across your MikroTik fleet with flexible filtering by site, time range, and aggregation interval—essential for bandwidth billing and usage reporting

### ✨ Enhancements

- **ISO 8601 Timestamp Standardization**: Implemented consistent date/time formatting across all API responses (reports, security scans, access controls, fault details, Configuration Backups)—dramatically simplifies integration and reduces parsing errors in client applications.
- **Enhanced Service Stability**: Increased memory allocation for core services improves performance during peak data processing—critical for large-scale deployments with hundreds of sites.
- **Richer Site Metadata**: Site serial numbers now included in minimal API responses—enhancing search capabilities and display options in client applications.
- **Configuration Backup Timestamps**: Backup listings now include `created_at` field—essential for tracking configuration change frequency and compliance auditing.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Fault API Consistency**: Fixed error when active faults had null resolution timestamps—API now correctly returns `null` for unresolved faults
