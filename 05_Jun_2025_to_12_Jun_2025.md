### New Features

We're excited to introduce powerful new capabilities for monitoring your network performance:

*   **Aggregated Network Performance Metrics:** Gain deeper insights into your network health with new API endpoints providing comprehensive aggregated data for your sites.
    *   **Network Throughput:** Easily retrieve aggregated network throughput (bits per second) across all your sites or specific ones, with flexible time windows and intervals.
    *   **Total Data Transferred:** Access total data transferred (bytes) across your sites, filterable by site IDs, time range, and aggregation intervals. These tools are designed to provide more insightful monitoring and high-level reporting on network usage.

### Enhancements & Improvements

This week brings a host of improvements focused on data consistency, system stability, and enriched information:

*   **Standardized Date and Time Formats:** We've implemented ISO 8601 standard formatting across various API responses and logging for dates and times. This ensures greater consistency and simplifies data processing for reports, security scans, access controls, fault details, and backup timestamps, making integration smoother for developers.
*   **Enhanced Service Stability:** Core service stability has been boosted with increased memory allocation, leading to improved performance, especially during peak data processing.
*   **Richer Site Information:** Site serial numbers are now included in minimal site data responses, enhancing searchability and display capabilities in client applications.
*   **Detailed Backup Information:** Backup listing and detail responses now include a `created_at` timestamp, providing precise information on when each backup file was generated.

### Bug Fixes

We've addressed a specific issue to improve system reliability:

*   **Fault Resolution Display:** Corrected an issue where an error could occur if an active fault had a null resolution timestamp in API responses. The API now correctly returns `null` for this field when a fault is still unresolved.
