### ‚ú® New Features

*   **New Workflow Actions: SSH & SMTP**: Automate even more of your operations! We've introduced two powerful new nodes for your workflows:
    *   **SSH Action**: Securely connect to remote servers to execute shell commands directly from a workflow. It supports both private key and password authentication using secrets from your Vault.
    *   **SMTP Action**: Send emails through any standard SMTP server. Customize your messages with dynamic content, attachments, and custom headers.
*   **CHAP Authentication Support**: Our authentication service now supports the Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), providing broader compatibility with a wider range of network devices and clients.
*   **Comprehensive Access Auditing**: For better security and oversight, we now record which user creates a Transient Access session. This information is available in the session details via the API.
*   **New Reseller Data API**: A new API endpoint is now available to provide a paginated list of official device resellers, complete with location, contact details, and filtering by country.
*   **Advanced Developer Protocol & Discovery**: We've rolled out a new, powerful protocol endpoint for programmatic interaction with tools, prompts, and resources. To simplify integration, we've also added standard OAuth 2.0 and health check discovery endpoints.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **API & Developer Experience**: We've made several improvements to make our APIs more robust and easier to use:
    *   **CORS Support**: Web applications can now directly interact with our APIs from different domains, enabling richer browser-based integrations.
    *   **Improved Authentication & Error Handling**: API error messages for authentication and actions like SMTP are now more descriptive and actionable. We've also standardized `401 Unauthorized` responses to help clients diagnose issues faster.
    *   **Pagination for Large Datasets**: Key API endpoints that list items like tools, prompts, and resources now support cursor-based pagination for more efficient data retrieval.
    *   **Helpful API Counts**: API responses for users and groups now include counts of their memberships, providing a quick at-a-glance overview.
*   **Increased Notification Group Capacity**: You can now associate up to 800 sites with a single notification group, a 4x increase from the previous limit of 200.
*   **Full History for Transient Access**: The API for listing Transient Access sessions now includes expired sessions, giving you a complete historical record of all temporary access.
*   **Improved Data Integrity & Reliability**:
    *   Group management operations are now fully atomic, preventing race conditions and ensuring data consistency.
    *   The crawling process for reseller and product data is now automated and more reliable, ensuring the information you access is always current.
    *   We added a security check to ensure users can only authenticate through network devices belonging to their own organization.
*   **Enhanced System Monitoring**: A new system event is now published when a site is deleted, improving integration with external monitoring and notification tools.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

*   **Reliable User & Group Management**: We resolved a critical data integrity issue by switching to stable, immutable IDs for all user and group associations.
*   **Improved Membership Listings**: Fixed performance issues that could cause slow or incomplete results when listing group members or a user's group memberships.
*   **Comprehensive User Deletion**: A bug was fixed where deleting a user did not always remove all their associated data (like group memberships). Deletions are now fully comprehensive.
*   **URL & Image Processing**: Corrected an issue where malformed URLs could prevent product images and reseller logos from being processed correctly.
*   **Corrected OAuth Configuration**: Fixed an issue where an incorrect URL was returned by our OAuth discovery endpoint, improving standards compliance for API clients.
