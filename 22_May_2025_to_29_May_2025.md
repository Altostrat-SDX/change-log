We're excited to share the latest updates from this past week, bringing you new capabilities and a smoother experience across the platform!

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Team Customization:** You can now update your team's display name and upload a custom logo image via the API, allowing for better branding.
*   **Simplified User Info:** The user information endpoint now includes additional identifiers related to your user and organization, making integrations easier.
*   **Streamlined User Invitations:** Inviting a user without assigning specific roles will now immediately create their account within the organization, simplifying onboarding.
*   **Direct Signup Link:** Integration points can now direct users straight to the signup form within the authentication flow using a specific parameter in the redirect URL.
*   **Subdomain Login:** The platform can now identify your organization directly from the subdomain of the login URL, simplifying the login process for organization-specific access.
*   **Organization Subscription Summary:** A new API endpoint provides a summary of an organization's subscriptions.
*   **Organization Usage Details:** A new API endpoint allows retrieval of detailed usage counts (like sites and VPN connections) for a specific organization using a dedicated token.
*   **Authenticated Billing Overview:** Logged-in users can now access a summary showing their organization's subscription quantity, used licenses, and available licenses.
*   **Support Integration:** User events now generate and store tokens in user metadata, facilitating single sign-on for support systems.
*   **In-App Guide Integration:** User events now generate and store identifiers in user metadata, enabling personalized in-application guides and onboarding features.
*   **Direct Subscription Management:** A new API endpoint redirects users directly to their dedicated portal page for managing a specific subscription.

### üöÄ Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Improved Team Branding:** When no custom logo is set, a default logo generated from your team's initials is now displayed, with refined generation logic for better accuracy.
*   **Enhanced Authentication Reliability:** Internal handling of access tokens has been improved for increased reliability and performance of API calls.
*   **Smarter Team Role Management:** Internal system roles are now hidden from user views and protected from removal via the API, enhancing security and usability.
*   **Clearer User Addition Message:** The success message returned when adding a user to a team has been refined.
*   **Reliable Organization Identification:** When an organization ID is provided via URL parameters or subdomain, the system now validates its existence before proceeding, improving the reliability of organization-specific logins.
*   **Predictable Redirects:** The logic for determining the final redirect URL after authentication has been simplified for more predictable behavior.
*   **Enhanced Customer & Subscription Details:** The customer API endpoint and the Organization Summary API now include more detailed information about customer tax details, associated subscriptions, latest invoices, next due dates, and creation dates.
*   **API Consistency:** The header used for authenticating usage lookups has been renamed for better clarity, along with the corresponding key in the API response.
*   **Improved API Error Handling:** The Usage Lookup API now returns a specific error response if the required authentication token is missing.
*   **Faster Usage Data:** Organization usage data used for license counting and the Usage API is now cached, improving response times.
*   **Flexible Summary View:** The authenticated summary endpoint now supports an optional parameter to retrieve subscription details without fetching real-time usage data.

### üêû Bug Fixes

*   Corrected the generated URL for uploaded team logos to ensure they are accessible.
*   Ensured the user-specific identifier returned in the user information response is calculated correctly.
*   Corrected the calculation for available licenses shown in the authenticated summary and internal license count endpoints to accurately reflect subscription quantity minus actual usage.

Stay tuned for more updates next week!
