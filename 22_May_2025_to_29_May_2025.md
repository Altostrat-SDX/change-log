This week delivers critical foundation improvements: major platform upgrades enhance reliability and performance, while refined timestamp formatting and user management ensure smoother operations.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Platform Foundation Upgrades**: Core components updated to latest versions—translating to improved performance, stronger security, and greater system stability across the entire SDX platform.
- **Accelerated Device Provisioning**: Optimized MikroTik device onboarding process delivers faster initial setup times—reducing field deployment time.
- **Enhanced User Management**: Upgraded user information systems with enhanced validation mechanisms ensure accurate contact detail retrieval and reliable user operations.
- **Intelligent Data Handling**: Systems now gracefully handle edge cases in user data, preventing errors and ensuring uninterrupted operation. Improved subscription limit validation during device provisioning prevents overages.
- **UTC Timestamp Clarity**: All network status alerts (site offline/online, WAN tunnel status) now include explicit UTC timezone information—eliminating timezone confusion for distributed teams and global MSPs.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Fixed deployment management links after device adoption—now correctly directs to device overview page
- Resolved notification delivery errors with invalid recipients—system now gracefully handles edge cases
