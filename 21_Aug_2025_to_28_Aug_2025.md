### New Features

*   **Build Custom Dashboards**: We've launched a brand new dashboarding system! You can now create and manage interactive, real-time dashboards to visualize your data. Widgets can display live information and trigger workflows, giving you a powerful new way to monitor and interact with your systems.
*   **Customize Your Organization's Branding**: You can now personalize your organization's appearance with a custom display name, unique colors, and a user-friendly login hint. New public API endpoints are also available to help you build fully branded login experiences for your users.
*   **New Powerful Workflow Actions**: We've added a whole new suite of actions to make your workflows even more capable:
    *   **Data & Logic**: Filter arrays, transform dates, validate data structures, and manipulate strings (including generating random strings, passwords, and UUIDs).
    *   **Integrations**: Easily connect to legacy systems with the new SOAP Request action.
    *   **Networking**: Generate WireGuard keys and retrieve details for IPv4 addresses directly within a workflow.
*   **More Advanced Interactive Forms**: Forms are now more dynamic. You can add multiple action buttons (e.g., "Approve," "Reject") to route workflows down different paths and conditionally show or hide fields based on user input.
*   **Fault Data Export Tool**: A new command-line tool is available for administrators to export historical fault data to a CSV file, perfect for offline analysis, reporting, and archival.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Guest & Device Connectivity**: We've improved how devices connect to your network. By correctly handling common operating system connectivity checks (including for Windows devices), client devices will now more reliably detect and display captive portals.
*   **Major Performance and Scalability Upgrades**: We've made significant under-the-hood improvements to boost speed and reliability, especially for high-volume environments. This includes faster event processing, caching for frequently used workflows, and database optimizations that make querying historical data much faster.
*   **More Reliable Site & VPN Management**: The processes for deleting sites and managing VPN instances have been completely overhauled to be more robust and prevent inconsistencies.
*   **Smarter Workflow Execution**: 
    *   Workflows with iterators can now be run sequentially, ensuring tasks are processed in the correct order.
    *   Form validations now run instantly upon submission, providing immediate feedback to users if corrections are needed.
    *   We've also improved the workflow scheduler to prevent duplicate runs and enhanced logging for easier debugging.
*   **Better Fault Analysis**: You can now filter faults by type (e.g., `site`) and combine filters more effectively. We've also boosted the performance of queries for recent faults and increased data retention from 90 days to 14 months, giving you a much longer view of historical trends.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue where alerts could occasionally be missing site-specific details or links.
*   Resolved a bug that could cause cached site information to persist after a site was permanently deleted.
*   Corrected an issue where date range filters were not applied correctly when querying for faults associated with a specific site.
*   Ensured that creating and deleting VPN instances now correctly handles potential errors during user seat adjustments, preventing billing inconsistencies.
