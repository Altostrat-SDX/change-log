This week's update delivers critical tools for MSPs and network administrators: real-time dashboards to monitor your MikroTik fleet, organization branding capabilities, and expanded workflow automation—all designed to help you manage your entire SDX platform more effectively.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Real-Time Custom Dashboards**: Visualize and monitor your entire MikroTik fleet with the new dashboard system. Create interactive, real-time dashboards with widgets that display live network data and can trigger automated workflows. Perfect for NOC displays and proactive network monitoring.
- **MSP Organization Branding**: Customize your organization's branding with custom display names, colors, and login hints. New public API endpoints enable you to build fully white-labeled login experiences for your managed clients.
- **Expanded Workflow Actions**: Power up your network automation with new workflow capabilities:
  - **Data & Logic**: Filter arrays, transform dates, validate structures, and manipulate strings (generate random strings, passwords, UUIDs)
  - **Legacy Integration**: Connect to legacy systems with the new SOAP Request action
  - **Network Operations**: Generate WireGuard VPN keys and retrieve IPv4 address details directly within workflows
- **Advanced Interactive Forms**: Build multi-step approval workflows with multiple action buttons ("Approve", "Reject") that route down different paths, with conditional field visibility based on user input. Ideal for change management and provisioning workflows.
- **Fault Data Export Tool**: Export historical fault data to CSV for offline analysis, compliance reporting, and trend analysis. Essential for capacity planning and SLA documentation.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Enhanced Captive Portal Detection**: Improved client device connectivity checks (including Windows OS detection), ensuring your guests reliably see and connect through Captive Portals without manual intervention.
- **Major Performance & Scalability Improvements**: Significant platform upgrades deliver faster speeds and better reliability for large-scale deployments—including faster event processing, workflow caching, and database optimizations that dramatically improve historical data queries.
- **Reliable Site & Managed VPN Operations**: Completely overhauled deletion processes for sites and Managed VPN instances to ensure data consistency and prevent orphaned resources.
- **Smarter Workflow Execution**:
  - Sequential iterator processing ensures tasks execute in the correct order
  - Instant form validation provides immediate feedback on submission errors
  - Enhanced scheduler prevents duplicate workflow runs
  - Improved logging makes troubleshooting automation easier
- **Extended Fault Management**: Filter faults by type (site, device, service) with enhanced query performance. Data retention extended from 90 days to 14 months—providing over a year of historical fault data for trend analysis and compliance reporting.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing site-specific details and links in alert notifications
- Resolved cached site data persisting after site deletion
- Corrected date range filter application when querying site-specific faults
- Fixed billing inconsistencies during Managed VPN instance creation/deletion
