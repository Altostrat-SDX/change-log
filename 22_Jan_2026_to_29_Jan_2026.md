This week, we're excited to roll out a major update to our reporting engine and introduce a suite of advanced tools for user and data management. These changes provide more automation, flexibility, and control.

### ✨ New Features

*   **Dynamic and Aggregated Reporting:** Creating reports is now more powerful and automated than ever. You can now configure reports to dynamically include devices based on tags, and then group and aggregate the results for deeper insights.
    *   **Tag-Based Selection:** Automatically include devices in reports by defining rules based on their tags, using AND/OR logic. New devices matching your criteria will be included automatically.
    *   **Group & Aggregate Results:** Group report data by a specific tag (e.g., "Location") and calculate metrics for the entire group using average, minimum, maximum, or redundancy uptime.

*   **Advanced User & Data Management:** We've introduced a powerful new set of tools for more granular control over user policies and sessions.
    *   **Data Quota Management:** You can now set data quotas for user groups. This enables dynamic policies, such as applying different speed limits once a user's data allowance has been exceeded.
    *   **Conditional Policies:** Apply network policies conditionally based on a user's status, such as whether they are within their data quota or have exceeded it, allowing for more flexible enforcement.
    *   **Remote Session Disconnect:** A new API endpoint is now available for administrators to remotely terminate an active user session, giving you immediate control when needed.

### 🚀 Enhancements

*   **More Frequent Security Scans:** You can now schedule vulnerability scans to run as frequently as every week, up from the previous minimum of every two weeks, for a stronger security posture.
*   **Upgraded Report Scheduling Engine:** The backend system for scheduling and generating reports has been completely rebuilt for significantly improved reliability and scalability, ensuring your reports are delivered on time.
*   **Improved Policy Flexibility:** Network policies can now be combined more effectively. For example, routing rules from multiple groups can be appended together for a user instead of overwriting each other.
*   **Increased Data Quota Limit:** The maximum configurable data quota has been raised to 10TB.
*   **API and Auditing Improvements:**
    *   Disconnecting user sessions is now more reliable and all disconnect actions are recorded in the audit logs.
    *   API responses for user and group attributes are now in a more consistent, structured format for easier integration.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **DNS Security:** We've corrected a recent configuration change to restore our default upstream DNS resolver, which actively blocks malware and adult content for enhanced security.
*   **Report Compatibility:** Fixed an issue where older report schedules could fail to load. We also resolved a bug that prevented the full history of generated reports from being displayed for some accounts.
