This week marks a major milestone with transformative updates to the SLA reporting engine and the introduction of advanced tools for managing user network access policies. These enhancements provide unprecedented automation, flexibility, and control for managing distributed MikroTik networks.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Dynamic Tag-Based SLA Reporting:** Creating and maintaining SLA reports just became dramatically more powerful and automated:
  - **Intelligent Tag-Based Selection:** Automatically include sites in your reports by defining rules based on their tags, using flexible `AND`/`OR` logic (e.g., include all sites tagged with `Location: New York` AND `Priority: Critical`). New sites matching your criteria are automatically included without manual intervention, ensuring your reports always reflect your current network topology.
  - **Site Grouping & Aggregated Metrics:** Group report data by any tag dimension (like `Region`, `Customer`, or `Location`) and calculate aggregated SLA metrics for the entire group using methods including Average, Minimum, Maximum, or Redundancy uptime calculations. This capability is invaluable for MSPs managing multiple customer networks or enterprises tracking SLAs across regional offices.

- **Advanced Network Access Control:** We've introduced sophisticated new capabilities for managing user policies and sessions:
  - **Data Quota Management:** Define data usage quotas for user groups with granular control. This enables dynamic enforcement policies, such as automatically applying bandwidth throttling or redirecting users to a notification portal once their allocated data allowance is exceeded.
  - **Conditional Policy Enforcement:** Apply network access policies conditionally based on real-time user status, such as whether they're within their data quota or have exceeded their limit. This allows for sophisticated traffic shaping and progressive enforcement strategies tailored to your network usage policies.
  - **Remote Session Termination:** A new API endpoint enables administrators to remotely disconnect active user sessions when needed, providing immediate control for security incidents, policy violations, or troubleshooting scenarios.

### 🚀 Enhancements

- **More Frequent Vulnerability Scanning:** You can now schedule automated vulnerability scans for your MikroTik fleet to run as frequently as weekly (increased from the previous two-week minimum), enabling a more proactive security posture and faster detection of newly disclosed RouterOS vulnerabilities.
- **Rebuilt Report Scheduling Engine:** The backend infrastructure for scheduling and generating SLA reports has been completely redesigned from the ground up, delivering significantly improved reliability, scalability, and performance. This ensures your scheduled reports are generated and delivered consistently, even as your network grows.
- **Enhanced Policy Flexibility:** Network access policies from multiple user groups can now be intelligently combined rather than overwriting each other. For example, routing rules from different policy groups can be merged together for users who belong to multiple groups, providing more nuanced access control.
- **Increased Data Quota Capacity:** The maximum configurable data quota has been raised to 10TB to accommodate high-bandwidth users and extended periods between quota resets.
- **API Improvements for Access Management:**
  - Session disconnection operations are now more reliable and all administrative disconnect actions are automatically recorded in your organization's Audit Log for compliance tracking.
  - API responses for user and group attributes now return data in a more consistent, structured format, making integration with external systems and custom dashboards easier.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **DNS Content Filtering Restoration:** We've corrected a recent configuration change to restore the default upstream DNS resolver settings, which actively block malware domains and adult content, ensuring your network maintains robust DNS-layer security protection.
- **Report Scheduling Compatibility:** Fixed an issue where legacy report schedules configured before the new reporting engine could fail to load properly. We also resolved a bug that prevented the complete historical report list from displaying for some organizations, ensuring full visibility into your past SLA reports.
