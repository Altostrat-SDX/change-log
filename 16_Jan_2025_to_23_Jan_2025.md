This week, we focused on enhancing reliability, improving user experience through clearer notifications and interface elements, and addressing several key bugs across the platform.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Improved Notifications & Reporting:** We've updated the template for 'Site Offline' notifications, refreshed email branding for a more consistent look, and enhanced the formatting of script authorization requests via WhatsApp for better clarity. We also improved validation messages for report schedules and streamlined recipient handling in the reporting API for easier management. PDF headers have been updated with a cleaner design.
*   **Richer Device Information:** The device API now includes hardware architecture and a unique hardware identifier, providing more detail about your connected devices.
*   **Enhanced Site Provisioning Notifications:** Automated notifications for key site provisioning events, including tunnel assignment, API credential creation, policy updates, and transient access/port changes, have been restored and improved for better visibility.
*   **Simplified Backup Management:** Your list of backup files is now consistently sorted by the actual backup time, making it easier to find the latest backups quickly.
*   **Updated VPN Domain:** The domain name used for VPN instance hostnames has been updated for consistency.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Reporting & Backup Accuracy:** We fixed issues where shared report URLs sometimes pointed incorrectly, ensuring links lead to the right reports. Resolved problems with backup file dates/times not displaying correctly and corrected the subnet list endpoint to exclude internal configurations.
*   **Policy and Connection Stability:** Resolved a bug that prevented policy changes from applying correctly in certain situations. Fixed a potential cause of connection instability by adjusting settings on VPN endpoints.
*   **Site and Device Management:** Fixed an issue where a site could potentially be assigned multiple tunnel IP addresses. Resolved a bug during the device adoption process that could interfere with existing setups.
*   **Notification Links:** Corrected button links in several email notifications (including scan reports, network alerts, and VPN credential messages) to ensure they direct you to the appropriate pages.

As always, these updates help make the platform more stable, reliable, and easier to use.
