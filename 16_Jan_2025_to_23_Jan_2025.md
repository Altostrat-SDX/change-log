This week accelerates security operations with faster vulnerability scanning, enhances reporting and notifications with updated branding, and fixes critical connectivity issues.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Refreshed Email Notifications**: Updated branding, standardized links, and consistent visual design across all email notifications.
- **Enhanced PDF Reports**: Polished report header design for more professional client-facing documents.
- **Accelerated Vulnerability Scanning**: Faster scan initiation for individual sites and improved scan result collection reliability—critical for timely security assessment.
- **Improved Report Scheduling**: Better validation messages simplify SLA report schedule configuration.
- **Focused Subnet API**: Site subnet lists now exclude internal management configurations for cleaner network documentation.
- **Richer Device Metadata**: Site API now includes device architecture and hardware hash—useful for inventory management and support.
- **Better Script Notifications**: Improved formatting for script authorization requests.
- **Optimized Device Onboarding**: Adjusted initial check-in frequency for newly adopted MikroTik devices streamlines provisioning.
- **Updated Alert Templates**: Refreshed network down alert messaging.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Report Access**: Fixed shared report link access failures—ensures stakeholder access to scheduled SLA reports
- **Scan Results Transmission**: Resolved complete vulnerability scan result transmission from agents
- **Managed VPN Connectivity**: Fixed management server identification and duplicate tunnel IP assignment during site setup—ensures reliable remote management
- **Device Adoption**: Corrected script conflicts with existing scheduled tasks during MikroTik adoption
- **Infrastructure Security**: Fixed firewall configuration preventing legitimate connections to managed infrastructure
- **Configuration Backup Timestamps**: Corrected backup timestamp display and sorting accuracy in UI
- **Email Notification Links**: Fixed vulnerability scan completion email links

### ⚠️ API Breaking Change

- **SLA Report Schedule API**: Removed `recipients` field from `GET /sla/schedules/{id}` response. Use `notification_group` field for recipient configuration. Update integrations accordingly.
