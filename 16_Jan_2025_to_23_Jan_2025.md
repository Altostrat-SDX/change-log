We've rolled out a series of updates this week across our services to enhance performance, reliability, and your overall experience. Here's a summary of what's new:

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   Updates to email notifications, featuring a refreshed look, updated branding, and standardized links for a more consistent experience.
*   Visual improvements to PDF report headers for a polished appearance.
*   Security scan performance enhancements, including faster initiation of scans for individual sites and improved reliability in collecting results.
*   Better validation messages for report scheduling, making it easier to correct invalid entries.
*   The list of site subnets available via API is now more focused, excluding internal configurations.
*   More detailed device information (architecture, hardware hash) is now available via the Site API.
*   Improved formatting for script authorization request notifications.
*   Adjusted the initial check-in frequency for newly adopted devices to optimize the onboarding process.
*   Updated the template for network down alerts.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed issues preventing access to generated reports via shared links.
*   Resolved problems with complete security scan results transmission from agents.
*   Enhanced connection reliability by fixing issues with management server identification and ensuring sites receive a single tunnel IP during setup.
*   Corrected a bug in the device adoption script that could interfere with existing scheduled tasks.
*   Addressed a network configuration issue on managed infrastructure to prevent legitimate connections from being blocked.
*   Fixed inaccuracies in backup timestamps and sorting displayed in the UI.
