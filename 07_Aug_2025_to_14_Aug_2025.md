This week focuses on proactive network health monitoring: automatically detect and respond to WAN quality issues, access deeper historical insights, and enjoy faster dashboard performance across your entire MikroTik fleet.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Automated WAN Quality Monitoring**: Receive instant notifications when a WAN tunnel experiences significant packet loss—and again when it recovers. Trigger custom workflows using new events (`wan.packet_loss_started`, `wan.packet_loss_resolved`) to automate remediation: failover to backup links, notify on-call engineers, or create tickets in your ITSM system.
- **Extended Historical Data Access**: Unlock long-term performance analysis with up to 30 days of fault history and historical device statistics (CPU, memory, uptime) for any date range. Critical for capacity planning, SLA reporting, and identifying recurring issues.
- **Fleet-Wide Tunnel Inventory**: New API endpoint retrieves all configured WAN tunnels across your entire network in one call—perfect for compliance audits, configuration verification, and security reviews.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Faster Dashboard Loading**: Optimized time-series data delivery dramatically speeds up chart rendering, especially over longer time ranges—essential for NOC displays and executive dashboards.
- **Enhanced WAN Status Accuracy**: Improved tunnel status detection reduces false negatives, with more reliable SLA report data collection for accurate uptime reporting.
- **Detailed Packet Loss Events**: Notifications now include the specific tunnel ID, enabling faster troubleshooting and precise incident documentation.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Resolved incorrect timestamps in aggregated chart data
