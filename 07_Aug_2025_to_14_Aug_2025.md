This week is all about giving you deeper insights and more control over your network's health. We're rolling out proactive alerts for network quality, new ways to access historical data, and significant performance boosts to your dashboards.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Proactive Packet Loss Alerts & Automated Workflows:** You can now receive automatic notifications the moment a WAN tunnel experiences significant packet loss and again when it recovers. Even better, you can use these new events (`wan.packet_loss_started` and `wan.packet_loss_resolved`) to trigger custom workflows, enabling automated responses to network quality issues.
*   **Deeper Historical Insights:** Gain a clearer picture of long-term performance with new ways to access historical data. You can now retrieve up to 30 days of fault history and query historical device performance statistics (like CPU, memory, and uptime) for any date range.
*   **Comprehensive Tunnel Overview:** A new option is available to retrieve a complete list of all configured WAN tunnels across all your sites, making network-wide audits and configurations simpler.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Faster-Loading Charts:** We've optimized how time-series data is delivered, making your charts and dashboards load significantly faster, especially over longer time ranges.
*   **More Accurate Network Status:** We've improved the accuracy of WAN tunnel status detection, reducing the chance of false negatives. We've also enhanced the reliability of data gathering for SLA (Service Level Agreement) reports.
*   **Richer Event Details:** Packet loss notifications now include a specific tunnel ID, making it easier to pinpoint the exact location of a network issue.

### üêû Bug Fixes

*   **Accurate Chart Timestamps:** We resolved an issue that could cause incorrect timestamps in aggregated data, ensuring the data you see in your charts is always accurate.
