This week, we're excited to release significant updates focused on enhancing your security posture, improving system performance, and refining the user experience.

### New Features

*   **Enhanced Vulnerability Management:** Gain finer control over vulnerability tracking. You can now view historical status and manage the status (like marking as accepted or mitigated) for vulnerabilities linked to specific network devices, including adding justifications and expiration dates.
*   **AI-Powered Mitigation Assistance:** Quickly access AI-generated, actionable steps to help you remediate identified vulnerabilities. The output format is also improved for clarity.
*   **Asset-Centric Vulnerability View:** Easily retrieve a comprehensive list of all network devices found across your scans that have associated vulnerabilities, including useful summary statistics.

### Improvements

*   **Performance & Reliability:** We've boosted the performance of fetching certain security credentials and increased internal API request limits to support higher usage. Reliability in processing vulnerability data and applying filters based on application categories has also been enhanced.
*   **API Usability & Stability:** Improvements include more appropriate responses when API lookups yield no results, implementation of rate limiting on specific endpoints for better stability, and general internal updates for system health and consistency.
