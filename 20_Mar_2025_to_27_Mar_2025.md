This week strengthens security posture management: track vulnerability remediation at the device level, leverage AI for mitigation guidance, and gain fleet-wide security visibility.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Device-Level Vulnerability Tracking**: Manage vulnerability status (Accepted, Mitigated) per MikroTik device with justifications and expiration dates—essential for compliance audits and documenting risk acceptance decisions.
- **AI-Powered Mitigation Guidance**: Access AI-generated, actionable remediation steps for identified vulnerabilities with improved formatting—accelerates security response and reduces research time.
- **Asset-Centric Security View**: Retrieve comprehensive list of all devices with vulnerabilities across scans with summary statistics—perfect for executive security dashboards and fleet-wide risk assessment.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Performance Improvements**: Accelerated Managed VPN credential fetching and increased API request limits support higher usage patterns.
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Improved vulnerability data processing and DNS Content Filtering category-based filtering.
- **Optimized API Responses**: More appropriate responses for empty lookup results, rate limiting on security endpoints for stability, and general system health improvements.
