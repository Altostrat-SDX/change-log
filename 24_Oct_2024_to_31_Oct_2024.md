### Weekly Summary (Oct 24 - Oct 31, 2024)

Following last week's comprehensive platform launch, this week was dedicated to stabilizing core infrastructure and bringing further foundational services online.

**New Service Activations & Initial Capabilities:**

*   **Network Inventory (`arp`):** The `arp` service is now active, with initial synchronization logic deployed to begin tracking network device ARP/DHCP/CDP data from sites. This provides the first layer of device inventory.
*   **Scripting Foundation (`scripts`, `script-hydration`):**
    *   The `scripts` service has been deployed, establishing the core framework for managing and scheduling script executions. Initial capabilities for defining scripts are in place.
    *   The `script-hydration` service is also online, ready to process SNS events, fetch site information, and inject variables into scripts before execution.
*   **Device Backups (`backups`):** The foundational `backups` service is now operational. Integration with AWS S3 for storing MikroTik configuration backups is complete, and the basic API for listing available backups per site is active.
*   **Webhook Relay (`webhooks`):** The `webhooks` service has been activated, providing the initial capability to receive Vapor/SNS notifications and relay formatted messages to Slack, configured via the `metadata` service.

**Platform Focus:**

This week focused on maintaining the stability and performance of our existing systems. While no new major public-facing features or specific bug fixes were deployed beyond the service activations above, our teams continue to work diligently on foundational enhancements and exciting new capabilities planned for future releases.
