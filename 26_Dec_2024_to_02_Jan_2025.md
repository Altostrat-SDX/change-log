### What's New This Week

*   **Comprehensive Device Monitoring (via `mikrotik` service):** Real-time device online/offline status monitoring (`has_pulse` flag) is now fully activated and reflected across the platform. This provides instant visibility into your connected infrastructure's availability.
*   **Detailed Performance Metrics (via `metrics` & `mikrotik` services):** The `metrics` service, in conjunction with `mikrotik` heartbeat processing, now collects and stores detailed device performance metrics including CPU load, memory usage, uptime, and free disk space. This historical data is accessible for deeper insights into device health and performance trends.

### Enhancements & Improvements

We've focused on improving the reliability and stability of core functions for services activated in previous weeks:

*   **Enhanced Reliability for Transient Access (`control-plane` service):** Improved the reliability of temporary access credentials (Winbox/SSH) and port forwards to ensure they expire correctly and are consistently applied/removed on management servers.
*   **Improved Management Server Mapping (`control-plane` & `mikrotik` services):** Enhanced the accuracy and reliability in mapping sites to their managing servers, ensuring commands and configurations reach the correct destinations.
*   **Smoother Device Adoption (`mikrotik` & `control-plane` services):** Improved the reliability of the process for adding new devices to the platform, including bootstrap script delivery and initial heartbeat processing.
*   **Reliable Backups (`backups` & `mikrotik` services):** Enhanced the reliability of automated backup generation triggered via SNS and processed by the `mikrotik` service, with configurations securely stored by the `backups` service in S3.

### Bug Fixes

Addressed minor issues to improve overall system stability:

*   **Performance Data Processing (within `metrics` service):** Resolved minor issues related to the ingestion and processing of performance metric data from `mikrotik` service heartbeats.
*   **Backup Data Access (within `backups` service):** Fixed potential issues that, in rare cases, could prevent access to site-specific backup data, ensuring consistent availability of stored configurations.
