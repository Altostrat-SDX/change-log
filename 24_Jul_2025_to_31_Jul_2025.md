This week focuses on operational efficiency: retrieve Configuration Backups at scale, leverage AI for network discovery, and enhance your workflow automations with powerful date manipulation tools.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Bulk Configuration Backup API**: New endpoint retrieves the latest backup content for multiple sites in a single request—dramatically reducing API calls for compliance audits, disaster recovery planning, and cross-site configuration verification.
- **Scheduled Script Notifications**: Stay informed with email alerts for scheduled script execution: authorization requests, launch confirmations, and completion status. Critical for audit trails and compliance documentation.
- **Enhanced Synchronous API**: Now supports array parameters for complex command structures—enabling sophisticated device management operations in a single API call.
- **AI-Powered MAC Vendor Lookup**: AI can now identify device manufacturers from MAC addresses (with bulk lookup support)—invaluable for network discovery, security analysis, and inventory management.
- **Enhanced AI Product Knowledge**: Upgraded knowledge base provides comprehensive hardware specifications and product catalog search—helping you quickly identify compatible devices and plan deployments.
- **AI Batch Backup Retrieval**: AI's backup tool now supports batch mode—retrieve multiple site configurations simultaneously for faster cross-site analysis and troubleshooting.
- **Advanced Workflow Date Filters**: New `carbon_date` and `carbon_condition` Liquid filters enable robust date parsing, formatting, and conditional checks (`is_today`, `within_7_days`)—essential for time-based automation rules.
- **Human-Readable Workflow Schedules**: Scheduled workflows now display next run time in plain language ("in 5 minutes", "tomorrow")—improving operational transparency.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Improved Site Management**:
  - More accurate recently-accessed site tracking for faster navigation
  - Enhanced reliability for site status, last-seen times, and uptime reporting
  - Efficient cache clearing on site deletion ensures data consistency
  - Automated cleanup processes improve resource management at scale
- **Reliable Email Delivery**: Retry mechanism for all email notifications dramatically improves delivery reliability—critical for alert notifications and compliance.
- **Dual-Channel Script Notifications**: All scheduled script alerts now sent via both email and primary notification channel for redundant delivery.
- **Strengthened API Security**: Enhanced authentication/authorization across all API routes.
- **Extended API Timeouts**: Increased operation timeouts reduce failures on complex long-running requests.
- **Deeper AI Investigation**: AI now performs more analytical steps for complex queries—delivering more comprehensive network insights.
- **Refined AI Tooling**: Improved descriptions and read-only operation emphasis for safer, faster AI interactions.
- **Flexible AI Authentication**: Bearer token clearing ensures AI always operates with current credentials.
- **Robust Workflow Date Handling**:
  - Wider date format parsing for flexible automation rules
  - Accurate next-run calculation prevents schedule drift
  - Enhanced "Test Node" support for scheduled triggers
  - Improved completion detection for complex branching workflows
- **Core System Stability**: Updated libraries and dependencies boost platform stability, security, and performance.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes
