### What's New

*   **Bulk Backup Retrieval API:** Introduced a new API endpoint allowing you to efficiently retrieve the latest backup content for multiple sites in a single request, significantly reducing the number of API calls needed for verification.
*   **Scheduled Script Email Notifications:** Stay informed with new email notifications for your scheduled scripts, covering important status updates like when they start, require authorization, and complete their execution.
*   **Flexible API Command Execution:** Our synchronous API now supports array parameters, offering greater flexibility for sending complex command structures to target devices.
*   **AI-Powered MAC Vendor Lookup:** The AI can now identify network device manufacturers based on their MAC addresses. This new tool supports bulk lookups and is valuable for network discovery and security analysis.
*   **Enhanced AI Product Knowledge:** Our AI's knowledge base has been upgraded to provide comprehensive product information. It now supports retrieving hardware specifications for deployed devices and a new product catalog search mode.
*   **AI Batch Backup Retrieval:** The AI's backup retrieval tool now offers an efficient batch mode, allowing you to get the latest configuration backup content for multiple sites simultaneously, speeding up cross-site analysis.
*   **Advanced Workflow Date Manipulation:** New `carbon_date` and `carbon_condition` Liquid filters are now available in workflows. These enable robust date parsing, formatting, and a variety of conditional checks like `is_today` or `within_7_days`.
*   **Clearer Scheduled Workflow Feedback:** Scheduled workflows now include a human-readable phrase (e.g., "in 5 minutes", "tomorrow") indicating when the next run is scheduled, improving transparency.

### Enhancements & Optimizations

*   **Improved Backend Processing:** Optimized internal systems for coupon generation and processing, enhancing reliability and efficiency, especially for large-scale background tasks.
*   **Core System Stability & Performance:** Updated core libraries and dependencies across various services to boost overall stability, security, and performance.
*   **Better Site Management Experience:**
    *   Your list of recently accessed sites is now more accurate and efficiently managed, ensuring relevant sites are easily accessible.
    *   Enhanced reliability and consistency for site status, last seen time, and uptime reporting.
    *   More effective clearing of associated cached data when sites are deleted, leading to improved data consistency.
    *   Underlying performance and stability updates, including automated data cleanup processes, ensure better overall resource management.
*   **More Reliable Email Delivery:** Implemented a retry mechanism for sending emails, which significantly improves the resilience and reliability of all email notifications.
*   **Dual-Channel Script Notifications:** All scheduled script notifications, including authorization requests, launch confirmations, and completion updates, are now sent via both email and the primary notification channel for greater reliability and prompt updates.
*   **Strengthened API Security:** Enhanced authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API routes, strengthening overall service security.
*   **Increased API Operation Timeouts:** Extended the maximum execution time for long-running service operations to reduce timeouts for complex requests and improve overall reliability.
*   **Deeper AI Investigation:** The AI is now configured to perform more steps in complex investigations, increasing its problem-solving and analysis capabilities, especially for multi-faceted queries.
*   **Clearer AI Tool Usage Guidance:** Improved descriptions and parameter handling for AI's API tools, providing explicit instructions and emphasizing read-only operations for better clarity and performance.
*   **Refined AI Batch Operations:** Adjustments to batch operations for AI's backup retrieval ensure more stable and predictable performance for large requests.
*   **Flexible AI Authentication:** Users can now include a new bearer token in their request to automatically clear any stale authentication, ensuring the AI always operates with the most current credentials.
*   **Workflows - Robust Date Handling:**
    *   `carbon_date` and `carbon_condition` filters can now parse a wider range of date formats, making date-based operations more flexible.
    *   More accurate calculation of next run times for scheduled workflows, basing calculations on previous runs to prevent time drift.
    *   Improved "Test Node" feature support for scheduled trigger configurations, enhancing the debugging experience.
    *   More accurate and reliable internal logic for determining workflow completion, especially for complex workflows with multiple branches.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Scheduled Script Authorization Link:** Fixed an issue where authorization URLs in scheduled script emails were incomplete or incorrect, ensuring you now receive a functional link.
*   **Email Template Discrepancies:** Addressed internal discrepancies in email template naming for scheduled script authorization, ensuring these important notifications are processed and sent as intended.
*   **Scheduled Script Email Delivery:** Resolved an issue that could prevent email notifications for scheduled script authorization requests from being delivered successfully.
*   **Accurate Workflow Duration:** Corrected an issue where the duration of a workflow run might be reported incorrectly; it now consistently displays a positive and accurate time difference between start and completion.
*   **Detailed Workflow API Action Errors:** When an API action in a workflow fails, its error message now includes the full response body from the API, providing more comprehensive debugging information.
*   **Reliable Workflow JSON Payload Resolution:** Fixed an issue where special characters in string variables could lead to invalid JSON when injected into JSON payloads, making workflow nodes that construct JSON bodies more reliable.
