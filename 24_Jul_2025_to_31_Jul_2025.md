### New Features

*   **Faster Access to Recent Devices:** We've made it smarter to access your most frequently used devices, keeping the 5 most relevant ones readily available for quicker navigation.
*   **Efficient Bulk Backup Retrieval API:** A powerful new API endpoint allows you to efficiently retrieve the latest backup content for multiple sites in a single request, significantly improving data gathering for complex systems and reducing API call overhead.
*   **Enhanced Email Notifications for Scheduled Workflows:** Stay better informed with new email notifications for your scheduled scripts, alerting you when they start, require authorization, or successfully complete.
*   **More Flexible API Parameter Handling:** Our synchronous API now supports array parameters, offering greater flexibility when sending structured data for your commands.

### Enhancements & Reliability

*   **Improved System Stability and Performance:** We've performed widespread updates to core dependencies and underlying libraries across various services. These foundational improvements contribute to stronger security, better overall performance, and enhanced reliability throughout the platform.
*   **Optimized Coupon Processing Reliability:** Internal adjustments have been made to improve the reliability and efficiency of how coupon generation jobs are handled, ensuring smoother and more consistent delivery of coupons.
*   **More Accurate Device Monitoring:** The "last seen" and "uptime" information for your connected devices is now more precise and up-to-date, prioritizing real-time data to give you a clearer and more current view of your network's health.
*   **Smarter Data Management and Retention:** Automated cleanup processes for historical statistics ensure optimal database performance. Recent data is retained for active sites, while inactive sites maintain only their latest entry, leading to more efficient data management and faster propagation of changes when site associations are updated.
*   **Robust Email Delivery System:** Our email notification system now includes an automatic retry mechanism, significantly improving the reliability of important messages and reducing the chances of transient failures.
*   **Stronger API Security and Extended Operation Timeouts:** We've implemented enhanced authentication middleware across our API routes to strengthen security. Additionally, the maximum execution time for service operations has been extended to 60 seconds, improving reliability for complex or time-intensive tasks.
*   **Expanded Notification Channels for Script Events:** Critical events for scheduled scripts, such as authorization requests, launches, and completions, are now reliably delivered via email in addition to existing channels, ensuring broader reach.

### Key Bug Fixes

*   **Resolved Scheduled Script Email Issues:** We've addressed and corrected several issues affecting email notifications for scheduled scripts. This includes fixing incomplete authorization links and resolving internal inconsistencies to ensure the correct email content is consistently delivered for these new notifications.
