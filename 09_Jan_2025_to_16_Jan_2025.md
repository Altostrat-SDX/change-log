This week enhances platform integrations, accelerates site data access, and ensures Configuration Backups display accurate timestamps.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Seamless Team & Subscription Integration**: Improved connectivity between web applications and team/subscription management features—smoother MSP workflows.
- **Accelerated Site Data Retrieval**: More efficient site information access—faster dashboard loading and API responses.
- **Streamlined Device Adoption**: Updates prevent configuration conflicts during MikroTik device adoption—reduces deployment errors.
- **Enhanced VPN Security**: Strengthened infrastructure security through firewall updates on Managed VPN endpoints.
- **Organized Configuration Backups**: Backup lists now consistently sorted by creation time (newest first)—faster access to recent configurations.
- **Platform Stability**: Core system library updates contribute to overall stability and security.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Accurate Backup Timestamps**: Corrected backup file time display showing creation time instead of filesystem modification time—ensures accurate Configuration Backup audit trails
- **Reliable Real-Time Messaging**: Fixed message delivery ensuring notifications only sent to active recipients—prevents unnecessary alert fatigue
- **Service Communication**: Resolved inter-service communication issues for enhanced platform stability
