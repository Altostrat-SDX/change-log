This week marks a transformative release focused on operational intelligence and automation. We're introducing a complete suite of AI-powered tools that fundamentally change how you diagnose issues, audit security, and automate network management tasks. Combined with a revolutionary new SLA reporting engine and platform-wide performance improvements, this release significantly enhances your ability to manage distributed MikroTik networks proactively and efficiently.

### 🎉 New Features

**AI-Powered Network Operations**

- **Comprehensive Device Diagnostics:** Launch a complete diagnostic suite on any MikroTik device using the new `Device Diagnostics` prompt in the AI Co-pilot, or get a fleet-wide health overview with the `Fleet Health Dashboard` prompt. These tools analyze connectivity, performance metrics, configuration issues, and potential problems across your entire network infrastructure.
- **Intelligent Fault Investigation:** Use the `Investigate Fault` prompt to perform systematic root cause analysis on any network fault or incident. The AI Co-pilot guides you through a methodical troubleshooting process, examining relevant logs, configuration changes, and performance metrics to identify the underlying cause.
- **Advanced Security Auditing:** Conduct organization-wide security assessments with the `Security Audit` prompt, or perform deep-dive site-specific analysis using the `Site Security Review` tool. These AI-driven audits examine Security Groups, BGP Threat Mitigation policies, DNS Content Filtering configurations, vulnerability scan results, and RouterOS security settings to identify potential weaknesses.
- **Conversational Automation Design:** Create sophisticated automation workflows and generate RouterOS scripts from natural language descriptions using the new `Automate Task` prompt and AI script generation capabilities. The Co-pilot helps you design event-driven workflows, schedule recurring tasks, and build custom orchestration logic without deep programming knowledge.
- **Configuration Change Tracking:** Easily track and audit configuration changes over time by generating detailed "diffs" between any two Configuration Backup snapshots. This capability is essential for change management, troubleshooting configuration issues, and maintaining compliance audit trails.

**Next-Generation SLA Reporting**

- **Dynamic Tag-Based Site Selection:** Create intelligent SLA reports that automatically include sites based on sophisticated tag-matching rules (e.g., `Location: New York` OR `Customer: Acme Corp`). Sites matching your criteria are automatically included as your network grows, eliminating manual report maintenance and ensuring reports always reflect current network topology.
- **Flexible Site Grouping & Aggregation:** Reports can now group sites by any tag dimension (such as `Region`, `Customer`, or `Site Type`) and calculate aggregated SLA metrics for each group using methods including Average, Minimum, Maximum, or Redundancy uptime calculations. This capability is invaluable for multi-tenant MSP environments or enterprises tracking regional performance SLAs.

**Developer Experience**

- **Recent Workflow Logs API:** A new endpoint (`GET /api/workflows/logs/recent`) efficiently retrieves the most recent log entry for each workflow in your organization, perfect for building real-time monitoring dashboards or integrating workflow status into external systems.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Rebuilt Report Scheduling Infrastructure:** We've launched a completely redesigned, cloud-native scheduling system for SLA reports, providing dramatically improved scalability, reliability, and performance. This ensures your scheduled reports are generated and delivered consistently, even as your network and reporting requirements grow.
- **Significantly Faster API Performance:** API response times have been improved across the board. Workflow run listings are now substantially faster, and new database indexes accelerate log filtering, search operations, and other frequently accessed data queries throughout the platform.
- **Enhanced Transient Access Flexibility:** The Transient Access feature for secure, time-limited device access now supports CIDR notation, allowing you to grant access to entire network ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) instead of only single IP addresses. This is particularly useful for granting temporary access to entire offices or VPN subnets.
- **Smarter Device Product Search:** The device product catalog search is now significantly more intelligent and accurate. Search algorithms now understand complex MikroTik product codes, match against both product names and model numbers, and can identify individual products within hardware bundles, making it easier to find and track specific device types across your fleet.
- **More Reliable Third-Party Integrations:** The Workflow Engine's authentication token refresh mechanism for third-party API integrations (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.) is now more robust under high load. Workflows also fail faster with clearer error messages when a connected account's authorization is revoked, improving troubleshooting and reducing unnecessary retry attempts.
- **Reduced Event Noise:** We've refined device event detection logic to eliminate unnecessary "device rebooted" events that were previously triggered every time a device checked in normally. This reduces alert fatigue and makes genuine reboot events more noticeable.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Workflow Log Ordering:** Fixed an issue that could occasionally cause workflow execution logs to display out of chronological order, ensuring audit trails and troubleshooting workflows remain accurate.
- **Historical Report Access:** Resolved a bug where PDF download links for some historical SLA reports were generated incorrectly, preventing access to older reports.
- **Product Code Search:** Corrected a search indexing issue where MikroTik product codes containing a `+` symbol weren't handled properly during searches.
- **Legacy Report Compatibility:** Ensured that older, manually created report schedules configured before the new reporting engine was deployed continue to function correctly without requiring migration.
