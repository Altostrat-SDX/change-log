This week, we're excited to roll out a major release focused on giving you deeper insights, more powerful reporting, and a faster, more reliable experience. We've introduced a full suite of AI-powered tools to help you diagnose issues, audit security, and automate tasks, alongside a completely new engine for SLA reporting.

### ✨ New Features

**AI-Powered Diagnostics, Security, and Automation**

*   **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Run a full diagnostic suite on any device with the new `Device Diagnostics` prompt, or get a high-level overview of your entire network with the `Fleet Health Dashboard` prompt.
*   **Guided Troubleshooting**: Use the `Investigate Fault` prompt to perform a systematic root cause analysis on any network fault.
*   **Powerful Security Audits**: Perform an organization-wide `Security Audit` or a deep-dive `Site Security Review` to analyze policies, vulnerabilities, and configurations.
*   **AI-Assisted Automation**: Design automation workflows and generate RouterOS scripts from natural language descriptions with the new `Automate Task` and AI Script Generation tools.
*   **Configuration Tracking**: Easily track configuration changes over time by generating a "diff" between any two device backups.

**Advanced Reporting Capabilities**

*   **Dynamic, Tag-Based Reports**: Create dynamic SLA reports that automatically include sites based on their tags (e.g., `Location: New York`). You can combine multiple tags with `AND`/`OR` logic for ultimate flexibility.
*   **Site Grouping & Aggregation**: Reports can now group sites by a specific tag and calculate an aggregated SLA for the entire group using methods like Average, Minimum, or Redundancy uptime.

**Developer & API**

*   **Recent Workflow Logs**: A new API endpoint (`GET /logs/recent`) is now available to efficiently retrieve the latest log entry for each of your workflows, perfect for building monitoring dashboards.

### 🚀 Enhancements

*   **All-New Report Scheduling Engine**: We've launched a more scalable and reliable scheduling system to ensure your reports are generated on time, every time.
*   **Faster API Performance**: We've significantly improved API response times across the board. Listing workflow runs is now much faster, and new database indexes speed up log filtering and other operations.
*   **More Flexible Access Controls**: The "Transient Access" feature now supports CIDR notation, allowing you to grant access to entire network ranges (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) instead of just single IPs.
*   **Smarter Product Search**: Searching for device product information is now more accurate and relevant. The search now understands complex product codes, matches against names and models, and can even find individual products within a bundle.
*   **Improved Automation Reliability**: The system for refreshing authentication tokens for third-party API integrations is now more robust, preventing failures under high load. Workflows will also fail faster with clearer errors if a connected account's authorization is revoked.
*   **Reduced Event Noise**: We've adjusted our event logic to be smarter, so you'll no longer see an unnecessary "rebooted" event every time a device checks in.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue that could cause workflow logs to appear out of chronological order.
*   Resolved a bug where PDF download links for some historical reports were incorrect.
*   Corrected a search issue where product codes containing a `+` symbol were not handled properly.
*   Ensured that older, manually created report schedules continue to function correctly with the new reporting engine.
