### Enhancements

*   We've added enhanced validation for notification group recipients. This ensures that when you view a group, the list includes only active and valid users, making managing your notifications more reliable.
*   To further improve notification accuracy, the system now requires and validates recipient IDs when you create or update notification groups, ensuring messages go to valid users.
*   Notification recipient channels are now explicitly validated to accept only supported methods like email and WhatsApp, helping guarantee delivery through your preferred channels.
*   Application icons are now sourced from our standard content delivery network (CDN), which may improve performance and reliability when displaying them.
*   During the site adoption process, we've improved the handling of customer account details to ensure more reliable checks for available capacity.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue that sometimes affected the validation of recipient IDs when creating or updating notification groups.
