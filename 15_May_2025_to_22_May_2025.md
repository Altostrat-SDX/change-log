This week expands communication channels with WhatsApp integration and enhances notification management with real-time validation—giving you more flexible and reliable alert delivery options.

### 🎉 New Features

- **WhatsApp Notification Channel**: Configure notification groups to send critical alerts via WhatsApp—providing an additional communication channel beyond email. WhatsApp now supersedes SMS for new and updated groups, streamlining alert delivery. Essential for on-call engineers who need mobile-first notifications.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Intelligent Notification Management**:
  - **Real-Time Recipient Validation**: Notification group recipients dynamically validated against the latest user directory—ensuring only active users are displayed for accurate group configuration
  - **Strict Recipient Configuration**: Creating/updating groups now requires explicit recipient ID and channel selection (Email/WhatsApp)—prevents misconfigurations and ensures consistent alert delivery
- **Faster Application Icons**: Updated CDN delivers improved loading performance and reliability for application data.
- **Enhanced Deployment Reliability**: System gracefully handles billing service responses during seat availability checks—ensures stable site provisioning and prevents deployment errors.
- **Platform Performance Upgrade**: Core platform upgrades deliver smoother, more responsive user experience.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Resolved false-positive invalid recipient ID flags during notification group configuration
