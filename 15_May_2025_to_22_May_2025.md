We've been hard at work this week delivering new capabilities, improving existing features, and fixing issues to make your experience smoother and more powerful.

### New Features

*   **Expanded Billing Capabilities:** You can now programmatically access your billing information, including payment methods, subscriptions, customer details, and invoices via new API endpoints. We've also added APIs to check your license and seat counts.
*   **Enhanced User & Team Management:** New API endpoints allow users to update their own profile details (name, email, validated mobile number), resend email verification links, and leave their current team. Team administrators can now update team names and logos via the API, including uploading new logo images.
*   **Improved Permissions Visibility:** You can now see the specific permissions associated with team roles and access more detailed information about available system permissions via dedicated API endpoints.
*   **API User Info Updates:** The main user information endpoint now includes additional technical identifiers and a token to facilitate integrations.
*   **Login Flow Flexibility:** The login process now supports passing parameters to allow for more specific experiences, such as direct invitations.
*   **Inbound SMS Integration:** We've introduced the capability to receive SMS messages and forward them for internal processing.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **API Performance Boosts:** We've significantly enhanced caching mechanisms for user and team data and optimized how we fetch lists of users, roles, and permissions, leading to faster responses across various endpoints.
*   **API Error Handling Refinement:** API error responses are now clearer and more consistent. Web-based errors will redirect users to a dedicated page with relevant details for better troubleshooting.
*   **Data Synchronization Reliability:** Improved background processes now ensure more consistent and up-to-date synchronization of billing information and user data between internal systems, preventing duplicates and handling missing data more gracefully.
*   **Subscription Detail Clarity:** The Subscription API now provides more detailed information about your plan, including tiers and discounts.
*   **Security Enhancements:** The new SMS receiving endpoint includes improved authentication via a shared secret.

### Bug Fixes

*   Resolved issues preventing direct linking to specific sections within external billing portals.
*   Corrected problems with background billing event processing caused by missing data identifiers.
*   Fixed an issue where organization display names were not correctly synchronized from billing system updates.
*   Addressed inconsistencies in API endpoint paths.
*   Resolved issues related to accurately retrieving user details when searching by email.
*   Corrected API response handling for user deletion actions.
*   Fixed problems displaying mobile phone details in user responses if user metadata was incomplete.
*   Addressed issues with the background job responsible for updating cached user information.
*   Corrected a bug that caused permissions to be incorrectly displayed when listing team roles.
