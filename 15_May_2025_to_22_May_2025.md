### What's New

*   **WhatsApp Notification Channel:** You can now configure notification groups to send alerts via WhatsApp, providing an additional and convenient communication channel for your critical notifications. For new and updated group configurations, WhatsApp now supersedes SMS, streamlining your alert delivery options.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Smarter Notification Management:** We've made significant strides in how you manage your notification groups:
    *   **Real-time Recipient Validation:** When viewing an existing notification group, recipients are now dynamically validated against the latest user directory. This ensures that only active and valid users are displayed, providing an accurate and up-to-date overview of your notification setup.
    *   **Stricter Configuration for Recipients:** The process for creating and updating notification groups has been strengthened. You are now required to explicitly define both the recipient ID and their preferred notification channel (Email or WhatsApp). This improves data integrity, prevents misconfigurations, and ensures alerts consistently reach the intended recipients.
*   **Faster Application Icon Loading:** We've updated our Content Delivery Network (CDN) for application icons, resulting in improved loading performance and greater reliability when you access application data.
*   **Enhanced Service Reliability for Deployments:** Our system now gracefully handles external billing service responses, ensuring a more stable and predictable experience when checking seat availability for new site deployments. This prevents potential errors and improves the consistency of site provisioning.
*   **Core Platform Performance Upgrade:** We've upgraded our underlying platform, enhancing overall performance and stability for a smoother and more responsive user experience.

### Bug Fixes

*   Addressed an issue where some valid recipient IDs might have been incorrectly flagged as invalid during the configuration of notification groups, ensuring accurate recipient validation.
