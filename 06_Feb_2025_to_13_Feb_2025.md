We've been working hard this past week to improve your experience with the platform. Here's a summary of the key updates:

### Enhancements

*   Your list of generated reports is now sorted with the newest reports appearing first, making it easier to find the information you need quickly.
*   We've made performance improvements to speed up the loading time for your list of reports.
*   The way your configured blocking policies are applied has been improved for greater accuracy, especially when applying rules for specific items within broader categories.
*   The information displayed in your "Recent Sites" list will now be more current, thanks to adjustments in how this data is cached.
*   General updates and optimizations were performed across the platform to enhance overall stability and performance.

### Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue that could occasionally prevent reports from generating successfully under specific circumstances.
*   Fixed a problem where certain specific blocking rules you configured might not have been fully enforced due to an error in generating the necessary configuration. Your blocking policies are now accurately applied as intended.
