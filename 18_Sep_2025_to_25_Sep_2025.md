This week, we're excited to roll out powerful new tools for branding and security, alongside significant enhancements to our billing system and overall platform reliability. Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs new.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Customizable Organization Branding:** You can now fully customize the appearance of your organization through the API. New endpoints allow you to manage your organization's display name, logo, and brand colors, enabling a consistent and branded experience for your users.
*   **Advanced Network Security (RadSec & EAP):** We've bolstered our security features with an automated Certificate Authority for RadSec (RADIUS over TLS). The system now automatically generates and manages client certificates for new devices, simplifying secure network deployments. We've also added support for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to enable secure authentication methods like WPA2/3-Enterprise.
*   **Expanded Payment Options:** To provide more flexibility, we've expanded our supported payment methods to include options like Amazon Pay, making the payment process even smoother.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Smarter Billing and Invoices:** Your invoices are now more detailed, with clear breakdowns for subtotal, taxes, and applied discounts. We've also improved the accuracy of subscription limit calculations and made our billing account system more robust, with better currency handling and safeguards to prevent accidental deletion of payment methods.
*   **Improved System Reliability:** We've made several under-the-hood improvements to ensure our platform runs smoothly. Schedule processing is now faster and more reliable, especially for accounts with many schedules. The system that generates security scan reports has been fortified to better handle heavy loads, ensuring you get your reports in a timely manner.
*   **Network Performance and Monitoring:** We've optimized how network device data is collected, reducing system load and increasing reliability. Additionally, the platform is now more efficient at detecting when a WAN tunnel goes offline, ensuring your network status is always up-to-date.

### üêû Bug Fixes

*   **Schedules:** Fixed an issue that prevented schedules with Sunday time slots from activating correctly. All schedules will now run as expected, any day of the week.
*   **Organizations:** You can now successfully remove an organization's profile picture. We also resolved a bug where changes to an organization's limits could be lost if other settings were updated at the same time.
*   **Coupons:** Corrected a bug that could cause PDF generation to fail for coupon schedules with a very large number of coupons.
*   **Usage Reporting:** Error messages for failed usage reports are now more descriptive to make troubleshooting easier.
