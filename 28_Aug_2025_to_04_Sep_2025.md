This week empowers developers and network administrators with powerful new APIs for fault management and data portability, while expanding DNS Content Filtering capabilities and delivering substantial performance enhancements across the SDX platform.

### ✨ New Features

- **Powerful Fault Management API**: You can now programmatically manage faults with a new set of API endpoints. This allows you to create, update, comment on, and delete faults, opening up new possibilities for automating your monitoring and response workflows.
- **Flexible Data Exports**: A new command-line tool is now available to help you easily export your service data. With support for SQL, CSV, and JSON formats, creating backups and migrating data is simpler than ever.
- **Streamlined Billing Management & Reporting**: We've introduced new capabilities to simplify billing. Integrated services can now provide direct links to a self-service portal to resolve payment issues instantly. We've also expanded our pay-as-you-go usage reporting to include SMS and email messages.

### 🚀 Enhancements & Improvements

- **Connectivity & Network Management**
  - **Expanded DNS Policy Lists**: The maximum number of custom domains you can add to DNS policy whitelists and blacklists has been tripled from 50 to 150.
  - **Smarter WAN Failover Alerts**: We've increased the time threshold for detecting a WAN tunnel as offline from 3 to 5 minutes. This change reduces false positive alerts caused by brief, temporary connection interruptions.
  - **More Stable Dynamic DNS**: The system that updates a site's DNS record when its IP address changes has been improved, making it more stable and resilient for connections with frequently changing IPs.
  - **Expanded Device Support**: We've lowered the minimum required RouterOS versions to `6.47` (for ROS6) and `7.8` (for ROS7), allowing a wider range of devices to connect to the platform.

- **Performance & API**
  - **Faster Fault Queries**: Querying for recent and unresolved faults is now significantly faster, making dashboards and API calls that rely on this data feel much more responsive.
  - **Standardized API Timestamps**: Timestamps in API responses for sites (like `created_at`) are now in the standard ISO 8601 format, ensuring easier and more consistent integration.
  - **Tighter API Security**: We've enhanced security across several services by enforcing stricter permission checks on API endpoints. Requests without the proper permissions will now correctly receive a `403 Forbidden` error.

- **Platform Reliability**
  - This week, we've rolled out numerous under-the-hood updates across our services, including dependency upgrades, caching improvements, and database optimizations. These changes enhance the overall security, performance, and reliability of the platform.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Alert Notifications Restored**: We resolved an issue that prevented alert notifications from being processed correctly and sent to services like Slack. All alerts are now being delivered as expected.
- **Improved Fault API Robustness**: The Fault Management API is now more flexible, correctly fetching or deleting faults whether or not the ID includes the `flt_` prefix.
- **Consistent API Responses**: The `comments` field is now guaranteed to be present in all fault data responses, preventing potential errors for API clients.
