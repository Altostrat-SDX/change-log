This week, we're excited to roll out powerful new tools for developers, significant performance enhancements, and key improvements to network stability and device compatibility. Here‚Äôs a look at what‚Äôs new for the week of September 4, 2025.

### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Powerful Fault Management API**: You can now programmatically manage faults with a new set of API endpoints. This allows you to create, update, comment on, and delete faults, opening up new possibilities for automating your monitoring and response workflows.
*   **Flexible Data Exports**: A new command-line tool is now available to help you easily export your service data. With support for SQL, CSV, and JSON formats, creating backups and migrating data is simpler than ever.
*   **Streamlined Billing Management & Reporting**: We've introduced new capabilities to simplify billing. Integrated services can now provide direct links to a self-service portal to resolve payment issues instantly. We've also expanded our pay-as-you-go usage reporting to include SMS and email messages.

### üöÄ Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Connectivity & Network Management**
    *   **Expanded DNS Policy Lists**: The maximum number of custom domains you can add to DNS policy whitelists and blacklists has been tripled from 50 to 150.
    *   **Smarter WAN Failover Alerts**: We've increased the time threshold for detecting a WAN tunnel as offline from 3 to 5 minutes. This change reduces false positive alerts caused by brief, temporary connection interruptions.
    *   **More Stable Dynamic DNS**: The system that updates a site's DNS record when its IP address changes has been improved, making it more stable and resilient for connections with frequently changing IPs.
    *   **Expanded Device Support**: We've lowered the minimum required RouterOS versions to `6.47` (for ROS6) and `7.8` (for ROS7), allowing a wider range of devices to connect to the platform.

*   **Performance & API**
    *   **Faster Fault Queries**: Querying for recent and unresolved faults is now significantly faster, making dashboards and API calls that rely on this data feel much more responsive.
    *   **Standardized API Timestamps**: Timestamps in API responses for sites (like `created_at`) are now in the standard ISO 8601 format, ensuring easier and more consistent integration.
    *   **Tighter API Security**: We've enhanced security across several services by enforcing stricter permission checks on API endpoints. Requests without the proper permissions will now correctly receive a `403 Forbidden` error.

*   **Platform Reliability**
    *   This week, we've rolled out numerous under-the-hood updates across our services, including dependency upgrades, caching improvements, and database optimizations. These changes enhance the overall security, performance, and reliability of the platform.

### üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes

*   **Alert Notifications Restored**: We resolved an issue that prevented alert notifications from being processed correctly and sent to services like Slack. All alerts are now being delivered as expected.
*   **Improved Fault API Robustness**: The Fault Management API is now more flexible, correctly fetching or deleting faults whether or not the ID includes the `flt_` prefix.
*   **Consistent API Responses**: The `comments` field is now guaranteed to be present in all fault data responses, preventing potential errors for API clients.
