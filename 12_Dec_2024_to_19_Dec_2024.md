### Weekly Summary (December 12 - December 19)

This past week, our development efforts were concentrated on crucial behind-the-scenes work aimed at strengthening the foundation of our services, with a particular focus on automation and infrastructure robustness. While there were no new major user-facing features, enhancements, or bug fixes deployed, these internal updates are vital for maintaining a stable, reliable, and performant platform.

**Key Internal Activities & Service Refinements:**

*   **VPN Service (`vpn`):** Adjustments and enhancements to the automated Vultr server provisioning and teardown processes to improve reliability and reduce deployment times.
*   **BGP/DNS Filter Service (`bgp-dns-filter`):** Internal tuning of the configuration generation logic for BIND and Bird services, improving efficiency and consistency of generated filter rules.
*   **Metadata Service (`metadata`):** Continued performance optimizations for DynamoDB interactions, ensuring faster metadata lookups for all dependent services.
*   **General Infrastructure:** Necessary updates to our underlying infrastructure configuration to support scalability and security best practices.

This ongoing work ensures we are well-prepared for future developments and continued growth.
