### ‚ú® New Features

*   **Bulk Data Import via CSV:** We're thrilled to launch a comprehensive new system for importing your data in bulk. You can now use CSV files to easily add or update Users, Groups, and NAS devices. The entire process is managed via our API, which allows you to upload files, preview content, and even perform a "dry run" to validate your data before committing. We've also included endpoints to download example templates to get you started.
*   **Metered Usage History API:** A new API endpoint is now available to retrieve historical, aggregated metered usage data for your billing account. This gives you the power to programmatically analyze usage for specific event types (like `sms_messages`) over any date range, with results grouped by day or hour.
*   **MS-CHAPv2 Authentication Support:** We've added support for the MS-CHAPv2 authentication protocol, expanding compatibility with a wider range of network hardware and systems.

### üöÄ Enhancements

*   **Powerful Workflow Filtering:** The "Array Filter" node in our workflow builder has been supercharged. It now supports complex filtering with nested `AND`/`OR` logic and the ability to either include or exclude matching items, giving you much finer control over data manipulation.
*   **Improved Data Migration:** The new Bulk Data Import system is built for scale, reliably handling files with over 300,000 rows. It also now supports importing `tags` and custom RADIUS attributes. If any rows fail to import, you can download a detailed log to quickly identify and fix issues.
*   **System Performance & Reliability:** We've rolled out several updates to make the platform faster and more robust. This includes significant improvements to overall API response times, more flexible timeouts for vulnerability scans on large networks, and better performance insights for NAS log requests.
*   **Clearer Troubleshooting:** Error messages for SSH actions within workflows are now more descriptive, making it easier to diagnose and resolve connection issues.
*   **More Accurate Reporting:** Incident end times in PDF reports are now correctly adjusted for the report's configured timezone, ensuring all your data is precise and consistent.

### üêû Bug Fixes

*   **Workflow Reliability:** We've resolved two issues that could affect complex workflows. A fix has been deployed for a validation check that sometimes prevented a workflow from being triggered by another. We also fixed an issue where an "Iterator" node (a loop) would fail to pass data correctly when triggering another workflow.
*   **Accurate NAS Timestamps:** An issue causing incorrect timestamps to appear in the NAS logs API has been corrected.
