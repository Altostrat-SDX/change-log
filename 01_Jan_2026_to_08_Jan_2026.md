Welcome to 2026! This week delivers a strong focus on giving network administrators more control over DNS Content Filtering, improving system performance across your MikroTik fleet, and enhancing our developer API.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Advanced DNS Administration Tools:** We've introduced a comprehensive set of command-line tools that provide administrators with granular control over deploying and managing DNS Content Filtering policies and categories across your network. These tools enable more efficient bulk operations, custom policy testing, and streamlined category management for large-scale deployments.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Faster DNS Policy Deployment:** Applying DNS Content Filtering policy changes to your MikroTik routers is now significantly faster and more reliable. We've optimized the background orchestration process to handle large and complex filtering policies more efficiently, reducing deployment time and improving consistency across your fleet.
- **More Frequent Site Health Metrics:** We've increased the collection frequency for critical site performance metrics including CPU utilization, memory usage, and uptime status. This enhancement provides you with more up-to-date visibility into your network's health, enabling faster detection of potential issues before they impact operations.
- **Enhanced DNS Filtering Performance:** Our upstream DNS resolvers have been upgraded to deliver improved content filtering accuracy and faster query response times, strengthening your network security while minimizing latency for end users.
- **Smarter Dynamic DNS Management:** The platform now handles temporary network connectivity issues related to dynamic DNS updates more intelligently, reducing false-positive alerts and improving overall system stability when sites experience brief internet outages.
- **Richer Developer API Capabilities:**
  - The platform statistics endpoint now includes the total count of configured authentication realms, providing better visibility into your access management configuration.
  - User detail responses now include a structured organizational path, making it easier to build intuitive navigation elements like breadcrumbs in custom interfaces.
  - Network device details clearly indicate auto-registration status, helping you track which MikroTik routers are configured for automatic fleet enrollment.
- **Enhanced RADIUS Logging:** Device identifiers in RADIUS authentication logs are now more consistent and predictable, making it easier to parse logs programmatically and build custom monitoring integrations.
- **Improved Security Certificate Standards:** RadSec security certificates generated by the platform now use an updated format that better aligns with industry best practices and modern certificate validation standards.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Enhanced Data Integrity for User Management:** We've strengthened the reliability of user account container merge operations. The background cleanup process now includes additional safeguards to maintain data integrity throughout the merge lifecycle, preventing potential edge-case issues.
