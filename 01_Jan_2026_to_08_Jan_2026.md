### Weekly Update: January 8, 2026

This week, we're excited to roll out a set of updates focused on giving administrators more control, improving system performance, and enhancing our API for developers.

### 🚀 New Features

*   **Advanced DNS Management Tools:** We've introduced a new set of command-line tools that provide administrators with more granular control over managing and deploying DNS policies and categories.

### ✨ Enhancements

*   **Faster DNS Policy Updates:** Applying your DNS policy changes is now significantly faster and more reliable. We've optimized the configuration process to run in the background, which is especially beneficial for large and complex policies.
*   **More Timely Site Metrics:** We've increased the frequency of data collection for site performance metrics like CPU, memory, and uptime, giving you a more up-to-date view of your network's health.
*   **Improved DNS Filtering:** We've updated our upstream DNS resolvers to provide better filtering accuracy and faster response times.
*   **Smarter Dynamic DNS Alerts:** Our system is now better at handling temporary network issues related to dynamic DNS, reducing unnecessary alerts and improving overall stability.
*   **Richer API Data:** For developers and integrators, our API has been enhanced:
    *   The main statistics endpoint now includes a total count of configured realms.
    *   User details now include a structured path, making it easier to build interface elements like breadcrumbs.
    *   Network device details now clearly show auto-registration settings.
*   **Greater Log Consistency:** Device names in our RADIUS logs are now more consistent and predictable, making logs easier to parse and understand.
*   **Improved Security Certificate Compliance:** We've updated the format for generated RadSec security certificates to better align with industry standards.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **Container Merge Reliability:** We've resolved a potential issue in the user container merge feature. The background cleanup process is now more robust, ensuring data integrity is maintained throughout the operation.
