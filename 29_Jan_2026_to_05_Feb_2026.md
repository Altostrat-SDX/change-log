This week delivers expanded organizational capabilities through comprehensive tagging features, alongside significant performance and reliability upgrades to your Managed VPN infrastructure and security policy enforcement systems.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Comprehensive Organizational Tagging:** You can now organize and manage your SDX infrastructure more effectively with expanded tagging capabilities. Tags can now be applied to organizational Account Containers and all RADIUS entities including Users, Accounts, Containers, and Groups. This enhancement enables sophisticated fleet segmentation, automated policy application, and dynamic reporting based on organizational attributes. We've also added a new API endpoint to efficiently query all Account Containers associated with specific tags, making it easy to build custom fleet management tools.
- **Optimized Managed VPN Status Reporting:** We've introduced a more efficient protocol for Managed VPN clients to report the operational status of multiple tunnel connections in a single API request. This optimization significantly reduces network overhead, accelerates VPN configuration synchronization, and improves overall responsiveness when tunnel priorities change across your distributed network.

### 🚀 Enhancements

- **Dramatically Faster BGP Threat Mitigation:** Security policy enforcement through BGP Threat Mitigation is now substantially faster and more robust. We've completely overhauled the IP blocklist processing pipeline, resulting in much quicker threat feed updates and enhanced system stability, even when processing very large threat intelligence lists. Your MikroTik fleet now receives security updates more rapidly, shrinking the window of vulnerability exposure.
- **Intelligent Managed VPN Recovery:** Managed VPN tunnel connections are now more resilient and self-healing. We've enhanced connection state tracking and implemented faster automatic recovery from network outages. The system now intelligently clears related monitoring alerts when tunnels successfully re-establish, reducing alert noise. API responses for VPN authentication requests now include additional context (such as `workspace_id`) to facilitate better monitoring and troubleshooting integrations.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **API Key Management Reliability:** We've resolved an intermittent issue that could occasionally affect API key creation and rotation operations, making these security-critical actions more dependable across all API interactions.
- **BGP Blocklist Data Integrity:** Implemented a fix to prevent duplicate IP addresses from being added to BGP threat mitigation blocklists, ensuring cleaner data structures and more efficient policy enforcement on your MikroTik routers.
