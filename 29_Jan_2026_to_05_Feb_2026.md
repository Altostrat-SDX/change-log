This week, we've focused on expanding your organizational capabilities with enhanced tagging, while also delivering significant performance and reliability upgrades across the platform to keep your services running smoothly.

### ✨ New Features

*   **Expanded Tagging for Better Organization:** You can now organize your infrastructure more effectively than ever. Tags can be applied to Account Containers and a wide range of RADIUS entities (Users, Accounts, Containers, and Groups). To help you leverage this, we've also added a new API endpoint to easily find all Account Containers associated with a specific tag.
*   **More Efficient VPN Status Reporting:** We've introduced a new, more efficient way for VPN clients to report the status of multiple tunnels in a single request. This speeds up configuration updates and improves overall network responsiveness, especially when priorities change.

### 🚀 Enhancements

*   **Faster and More Reliable IP Blocklist Processing:** Security policy enforcement is now significantly faster and more robust. We've overhauled our IP blocklist processing, resulting in much quicker updates and greater stability, even when handling very large lists.
*   **Smarter VPN Connection Management:** VPN connections are now more intelligent and resilient. We've improved connection state tracking and enabled faster, more automatic recovery from outages, which helps to automatically clear related monitoring alerts. API responses for VPN authentication also include more helpful context, like `workspace_id`.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **API Key Management:** We've resolved an intermittent issue that could affect API key creation and rotation, making these operations more dependable.
*   **IP Blocklist Integrity:** A fix has been implemented to prevent duplicate IP addresses from being added to blocklists, ensuring better data accuracy and consistency.
