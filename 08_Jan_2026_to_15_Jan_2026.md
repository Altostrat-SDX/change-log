This week focuses on improving data accessibility for network troubleshooting, enhancing search capabilities across your user base, and strengthening the reliability and security of performance metrics collection.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Expanded Authentication Log History:** We've significantly increased the retention period for network authentication transaction logs from 4 hours to a full 24 hours. This extended window gives network administrators substantially more time to investigate authentication issues, troubleshoot RADIUS connectivity problems, or analyze user access patterns across your distributed MikroTik fleet.
- **More Powerful User Profile Search:** User and account searches are now more comprehensive and accurate. We've expanded the search index to include network reply attributes assigned to user profiles, enabling you to locate specific users based on VLAN assignments, bandwidth policies, or other RADIUS attributes configured for your network access policies.
- **Flexible Custom Metric Labels:** Our metrics ingestion service now supports more flexible validation rules for custom label values, allowing you to use a wider range of naming conventions and special characters when submitting performance data from your network monitoring integrations.
- **Ongoing Platform Reliability:** We've deployed several behind-the-scenes improvements to our internal monitoring and logging infrastructure, enhancing overall platform stability and operational visibility.

### 🔒 Security & Fixes

- **Strengthened Metric Data Integrity:** We've resolved a critical security issue to ensure that system-managed labels—including organization IDs and workspace identifiers—are always enforced on incoming metric data. This fix strengthens data isolation and prevents the possibility of custom metrics being submitted with incorrect organizational context, ensuring your performance data remains securely separated in multi-tenant environments.
