This week, we've focused on improving data accessibility, search capabilities, and the overall reliability and security of the platform. Here are the latest updates.

### Enhancements

*   **Expanded Log History for Troubleshooting:** We've significantly increased the retention period for network access transaction logs from 4 hours to a full 24 hours. This gives you a much longer and more effective window for any troubleshooting or analysis you need to perform.
*   **More Powerful User Search:** User profile searches are now more powerful. We've included assigned network reply attributes in the search index, allowing for more detailed and specific queries to find exactly what you're looking for.
*   **Flexible Metric Labeling:** Our metric ingestion service now has more flexible validation, allowing for a wider range of values in your custom labels.
*   **Ongoing Reliability Improvements:** We've rolled out several internal improvements to our monitoring and logging systems to boost overall platform stability and performance.

### Security & Fixes

*   **Strengthened Metric Data Integrity:** We've resolved a critical data integrity issue to ensure that system-managed labels (like organization and workspace IDs) are always enforced on incoming metric data. This fix strengthens the security and separation of your data by preventing these important labels from being overridden.
