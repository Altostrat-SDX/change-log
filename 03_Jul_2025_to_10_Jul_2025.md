### Highlights of the Week

This week, we've rolled out updates focusing on aligning service usage with subscription plans, improving billing accuracy, and enhancing overall system reliability and tracking.

### New Features

*   **VPN User Seat Limit Enforcement:** To help you better manage your service consumption, we've introduced enforcement of user seat limits when creating new VPN instances or peers. Your subscription plan's user limit will now be checked during resource creation.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Billing Synchronization:** We've enhanced the integration with our billing system for more accurate and reliable synchronization of resource counts (like sites) when devices are added or removed. This improvement supports better alignment of your deployed resources with your allocated service limits.
*   **System Refinements:** Implemented various internal system refinements aimed at improving usage synchronization tools and error handling, contributing to a more robust and accurate platform.

### Bug Fixes

*   Resolved issues related to internal communication and logic that affected the accuracy of usage counts and billing synchronization. These fixes ensure more precise tracking of resource usage, including when adding new VPN peers, and better alignment with billing information.
