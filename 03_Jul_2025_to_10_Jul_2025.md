This week's updates bring a significant leap forward in AI capabilities, introduce powerful new tools for managing your resources, and deliver crucial enhancements to overall system reliability and performance.

### New Features

*   **Smarter AI, More Insightful Interactions:** Our core AI agent has received a significant intelligence upgrade, now leveraging an advanced intelligence engine for more sophisticated reasoning and problem-solving. This means more nuanced responses and richer, contextual insights into its decision-making processes, making your interactions more transparent and effective.
*   **Flexible Resource Management & Detailed Reporting:** We've introduced powerful new tools to give you greater control and transparency over your organization's resource usage:
    *   **Detailed Usage Exports:** Easily export comprehensive organization usage data in CSV or PDF formats, providing clear insights into resource consumption.
    *   **Advanced Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits with greater flexibility. You can now set limits to indicate "unlimited," explicitly "deny access" (set to zero), or define a specific positive integer for precise control.
    *   **Trackable Single Sign-On (SSO):** SSO is now a manageable resource type, allowing its usage and limits to be monitored alongside other resources.
    *   **Comprehensive Usage API:** A new API endpoint is available to retrieve a detailed summary of an organization's resource consumption, including current usage, effective limits, and available capacity.
*   **Automated Site Resource Allocation:** We've introduced automated management for allocated resources when provisioning new sites. The system now verifies resource availability before a new device can be adopted and automatically releases associated resources when a site is deleted, ensuring efficient utilization.

### Enhancements & Optimizations

*   **Improved AI Reasoning & Transparency:** Our AI now demonstrates a significantly more intelligent and adaptive thought process. Streamed insights provide richer context into its decision-making, including problem detection and progress assessment, with responses that are more human-readable and less focused on internal technical details.
*   **Enhanced User & Seat Management:** Tracking of user counts, particularly for VPN instances, is now more accurate and reliable, ensuring your subscription limits are consistently and correctly applied when managing users.
*   **Streamlined Organization Creation:** When creating new organizations via our API, default user roles are now automatically assigned and user authentication connections are configured, simplifying the initial setup process.
*   **Robust Resource Limit Validation:** Setting or updating organization limits now includes comprehensive checks to prevent configurations that would exceed your subscription capacity, violate parent organization limits, or fall below current usage levels.
*   **Enhanced Organization Profile Management:** Improved handling for organization profile pictures allows explicitly clearing a picture, consistent synchronization with user authentication services, and robust validation of uploaded image files, ensuring better reliability and appearance.
*   **Increased System Stability & Performance:** We've implemented several behind-the-scenes improvements to boost overall system stability, resilience against cascading failures, and faster API responses under concurrent load. This includes more reliable usage reporting mechanisms and consistent monitoring of services from our internal systems.
*   **Improved Internal Data Consistency:** New administrative tools have been introduced to automatically detect and correct discrepancies in user metadata and subscription records, ensuring greater accuracy and reliability of your data.

### Resolved Issues

*   **Stable AI Conversations:** Critical issues that led to inconsistencies in conversation history and premature terminations have been resolved. The system now includes robust validation and correction mechanisms, ensuring more stable and consistent long-running AI interactions.
*   **Accurate Usage & Subscription Tracking:**
    *   Corrected the logic for incrementing and decrementing user counts, ensuring that your allocated seats are precisely reflected in your subscription.
    *   Fixed the calculation of available capacity in organization usage summaries to accurately reflect the capacity available based on your entire organizational hierarchy, providing more precise information.
