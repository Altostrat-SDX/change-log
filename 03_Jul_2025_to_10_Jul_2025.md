This week brings significant advances in AI capabilities, introduces flexible resource management tools for MSPs, and delivers crucial platform reliability enhancements.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Advanced AI Intelligence**: Core AI upgraded to advanced reasoning engine—delivering more sophisticated problem-solving, nuanced responses, and transparent decision-making insights. Your AI assistant now provides richer contextual understanding for complex network questions.
- **Comprehensive Resource Management & Reporting**: New tools give MSPs precise control and visibility:
  - **Usage Data Export**: Export detailed organization resource consumption in CSV/PDF formats—essential for client billing, capacity planning, and compliance
  - **Flexible Resource Limits**: Configure "unlimited", "deny access" (zero), or specific integer limits for granular control
  - **SSO Tracking**: Single Sign-On now tracked as manageable resource alongside devices, VPNs, and sites
  - **Usage Summary API**: Retrieve comprehensive resource consumption data including current usage, effective limits, and available capacity
- **Automated Site Resource Management**: System automatically verifies resource availability before device adoption and releases resources on site deletion—ensuring efficient license utilization and preventing overages.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Enhanced AI Capabilities**: Significantly improved reasoning transparency with streamed insights into problem detection and progress assessment. Responses are more human-readable and focus on operational insights rather than technical internals.
- **Accurate Subscription Management**: Enhanced user count tracking (especially for Managed VPN instances) ensures subscription limits are consistently and correctly applied.
- **Streamlined Organization Setup**: New organizations via API automatically receive default user roles and authentication connections—reducing manual configuration.
- **Robust Limit Validation**: Comprehensive checks prevent resource configurations that exceed subscriptions, violate parent limits, or fall below current usage.
- **Enhanced Profile Management**: Improved organization profile picture handling with explicit clearing, authentication service sync, and robust file validation.
- **Platform Performance**: Multiple infrastructure improvements deliver enhanced stability, resilience against failures, and faster API responses under load. More reliable usage reporting and consistent service monitoring.
- **Data Integrity Tools**: New administrative utilities automatically detect and correct user metadata and subscription record discrepancies.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **AI Conversation Stability**: Resolved critical issues causing conversation history inconsistencies and premature terminations. Robust validation ensures stable long-running AI interactions.
- **Accurate Subscription Tracking**:
  - Corrected user count increment/decrement logic for precise seat allocation
  - Fixed available capacity calculations to accurately reflect organizational hierarchy
