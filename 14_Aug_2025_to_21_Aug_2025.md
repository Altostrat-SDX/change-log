This week delivers game-changing automation capabilities for network administrators and MSPs: transform your workflows into serverless APIs, send multi-channel notifications to your team, and standardize your operations with reusable script templates.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Advanced Workflow Automation—Now Production-Ready**
  - **Interactive Forms**: Build multi-step workflows with user approval gates—perfect for change management, device provisioning, and customer onboarding processes
  - **Serverless Workflow APIs**: Turn workflows into real-time API endpoints that accept requests and return immediate responses—ideal for integrating with ticketing systems, monitoring tools, and external platforms
  - **Enterprise Authentication**: Secure workflow APIs with dedicated API Keys or custom JWT authorizers for robust machine-to-machine integration
  - **Failure Recovery**: Resume failed workflow runs from any successful checkpoint—no more starting automations from scratch
  - **Liquid Templating**: Use advanced conditional logic, filters, and loops across all workflow nodes for sophisticated data transformation
  - **Granular Error Handling**: Configure expected vs. critical errors (e.g., handle 404s gracefully while failing on auth errors)
  - **SOAP Integration**: Connect workflows to legacy network management and billing systems via SOAP

- **Multi-Channel Notification API**: Send alerts and notifications to your team across multiple channels:
  - **Email & WhatsApp**: Deliver critical network alerts via email or WhatsApp for faster incident response
  - **Dynamic Targeting**: Route notifications to specific email addresses, phone numbers, or user groups based on tags (e.g., "on-call-engineers", "tier-2-support")
  - **Rich Content**: Send custom emails with attachments—perfect for automated reports, configuration backups, and compliance documentation

- **Reusable Script Templates**: Standardize your MikroTik scripting operations:
  - Create, manage, and deploy your most common RouterOS scripts from a central library
  - Share templates publicly with the community or keep them private to your organization
  - Accelerate deployments by reusing battle-tested scripts

- **QR Code Generation**: New CLI tool (`qr:generate`) for generating QR codes—useful for provisioning guest WiFi credentials and device onboarding workflows.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Performance Improvements:**
  - **Faster Network Interface Graphs**: Interface performance graphs load significantly faster on long time ranges through intelligent data aggregation
  - **Optimized Device Statistics**: Dramatically faster queries for CPU, memory, and performance metrics across long time periods
  - **Real-Time Event Processing**: Backend event processing now triggers workflows nearly instantaneously—critical for time-sensitive automations at scale
  - **Optimized Notification Delivery**: Smarter notification routing reduces overhead and speeds up alert delivery

- **Enhanced Reliability:**
  - **Resilient Workflow Scheduler**: New safeguards prevent duplicate scheduled workflow runs
  - **Automatic Retry Logic**: Port forwards and webhook notifications now automatically retry on temporary network issues
  - **Consistent Interface Statistics**: Improved data collection ensures your network statistics are always accurate and current
  - **Clean Site Deletion**: Hardened deletion process ensures all related assets (devices, VPNs, policies) are properly removed

- **Developer Experience:**
  - **Script Template Search**: Filter and search templates by visibility (public/private) and keywords
  - **Extended Script Limits**: Significantly increased character limits for script names, descriptions, and content
  - **Better Error Diagnostics**: Detailed workflow error messages pinpoint exact failure sources for faster troubleshooting
  - **ISO 8601 Timestamps**: All API responses now use standard ISO 8601 format for easier integration

- **Security:**
  - **Granular API Permissions**: AI chat API now requires specific `ai:chat` scope for enhanced access control

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- Corrected timestamp display on aggregated performance graphs
- Fixed false health check failures in internal polling service
