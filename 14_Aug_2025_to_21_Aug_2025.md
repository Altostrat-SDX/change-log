### ‚ú® New Features

This week, we're thrilled to launch a suite of powerful new features designed to enhance automation, communication, and development efficiency.

*   **Introducing Advanced Workflow Capabilities:** Build more dynamic, interactive, and robust automations than ever before.
    *   **Interactive Forms:** Create multi-step workflows that can pause to collect user input through dynamic forms, perfect for onboarding, approvals, and wizards.
    *   **Synchronous API Triggers:** Turn your workflows into real-time, serverless API endpoints that accept a request and return an immediate response.
    *   **Advanced Authentication:** Secure your new API-driven workflows with dedicated API Keys or custom JWT Authorizers for robust machine-to-machine communication.
    *   **Resume from Failure:** You can now resume a failed workflow run from any previously successful step, saving time and preventing full restarts.
    *   **Liquid Templating:** Leverage the powerful Liquid templating language within all workflow nodes for advanced conditional logic, filters, and loops.
    *   **Granular Error Handling:** Configure workflows to gracefully handle expected errors (like a 404 response) while still failing on critical ones.
    *   **SOAP Integration:** A new node has been added to seamlessly connect with legacy SOAP web services.

*   **All-New Notification API:** We've launched a flexible new API for sending multi-channel notifications.
    *   **Email & WhatsApp Support:** Send alerts and messages directly to users via email or WhatsApp.
    *   **Advanced Targeting:** Target users with precision by sending notifications to specific email addresses, phone numbers, or dynamic groups based on user tags.
    *   **Flexible Content:** Send freeform emails with custom subjects and bodies, and now include file attachments with your email notifications.

*   **Reusable Script Templates:** Save time and standardize your operations with the new Script Templates feature.
    *   Create, manage, and reuse your most common scripts.
    *   Keep templates private to your organization or share them as public, read-only resources for the entire community.

*   **Developer Utility: QR Code Generation:** A new command-line tool (`qr:generate`) is now available for developers to easily generate QR codes with customizable content, size, and format (SVG, PNG, JPG).

### üöÄ Enhancements & Improvements

We've focused on boosting performance, reliability, and the overall developer experience across the platform.

*   **Performance Boosts:**
    *   **Faster Dashboards:** Performance graphs for network interfaces now load significantly faster on long time ranges by displaying an aggregated view.
    *   **Optimized Statistics:** Queries for device performance metrics (like CPU and memory) over long periods are now substantially faster.
    *   **Improved Event Processing:** Backend event processing is now nearly instantaneous, allowing event-driven workflows to trigger much more quickly at scale.
    *   **Efficient Notifications:** The system is now smarter about sending notifications, reducing unnecessary requests and speeding up delivery.

*   **Increased Reliability:**
    *   **Robust Automations:** Scheduled workflows are now more resilient, with new safeguards to prevent a single job from accidentally running multiple times.
    *   **More Stable Connections:** Services that manage port forwards and send webhook notifications will now automatically retry on temporary network issues, reducing failures.
    *   **Consistent Data:** We've improved the reliability of network interface data collection, ensuring your statistics are always consistent and up-to-date.
    *   **Cleaner Deletions:** The process for deleting sites has been hardened to ensure all related assets are consistently and correctly removed.

*   **API & Developer Experience:**
    *   **Find Templates Faster:** You can now easily filter and search your Script Templates by type (public/private) or keywords.
    *   **More Detailed Scripts:** The character limits for Script Template names, descriptions, and content have been significantly increased.
    *   **Clearer Error Messages:** Failures within workflows are now easier to diagnose, with more detailed messages that pinpoint the exact source of the problem.
    *   **Consistent Timestamps:** All API responses now use the standard ISO 8601 format for timestamps, making integration easier.

*   **Security:**
    *   **Enhanced API Security:** Access to the AI chat API endpoint now requires a specific `ai:chat` permission scope, providing more granular control over API key access.

### üêû Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue that could cause incorrect timestamps to appear on aggregated performance graphs.
*   Fixed a bug where an internal polling service could incorrectly report a failed health status, improving the accuracy of system-wide health monitoring.
