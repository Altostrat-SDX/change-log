### What's New

We're excited to introduce several new capabilities designed to enhance your workflow and communication:

*   **Versatile QR Code Generation:** A new utility allows for generating customizable QR codes for various content, including VPN configurations. This tool offers options for size, multiple output formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, GIF), and specialized styling, making it easier to share configurations.
*   **Unified Notification API:** Experience a streamlined way to send notifications via Email and WhatsApp. Our new API supports both templated and freeform messages, with flexible recipient options including specific addresses/numbers or targeting user groups via custom tags.
*   **Email Attachments in Notifications:** You can now include attachments with your email notifications, enabling richer and more comprehensive communications.
*   **Robust Script Template Management:** A brand-new API and command-line tools empower you to create, manage, and reuse script templates. This makes it significantly easier to store, organize, and deploy common or complex scripts across your operations.

### Enhancements & Reliability

This week's updates bring significant improvements to platform performance, stability, and data handling:

*   **Improved Data Visualization:** Graphs for metric and WAN ping data across various dashboards now load faster and are more readable, especially when viewing data over extended periods, thanks to intelligent data aggregation.
*   **Enhanced Data Collection Reliability:** We've made SNMP data collection and internal metadata fetching more robust with added retry mechanisms, increased timeouts, and caching, ensuring more consistent and reliable data for your insights.
*   **More Resilient Operations:** Critical operations such as transient port forwarding and communication with external services (e.g., fetching site/customer metadata, sending emails, processing webhooks) have been significantly fortified. These enhancements, including robust retry mechanisms, increased timeouts, and caching, lead to greater stability and success rates, making your interactions more reliable.
*   **Streamlined Site Management:** The internal process for deleting sites has been refactored for improved reliability and efficiency, ensuring a robust and consistent cleanup of all associated assets when a site is removed.
*   **Flexible Script Template Capabilities:** Script templates now support longer names (up to 100 characters), more detailed descriptions (up to 200 characters), and larger content sizes (up to 5000 characters). We've also improved search and filtering options by name, description, and type, making templates easier to manage and find. Additionally, all API timestamps are standardized to ISO8601, and script content is accurately preserved.
*   **Platform Stability and Performance:** Underlying system libraries and dependencies have been updated across several services. These updates bring general stability improvements, performance optimizations, and important security patches, ensuring a more robust and reliable platform.
*   **Smarter Notification Delivery:** Email delivery reliability has been boosted with enhanced retry mechanisms. Recipient resolution for notifications is now more intelligent, automatically translating user IDs into the correct contact details.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Accurate WAN Ping Timestamps:** We've resolved an issue where timestamps for aggregated WAN ping data might not have been accurately reflected, ensuring precise temporal representation of your network performance data.
