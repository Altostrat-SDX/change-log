This week brings powerful new data export capabilities for custom analysis, significant performance enhancements for SLA reporting workflows, and a smarter AI experience for network operations. These updates continue our focus on operational efficiency and intelligence.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Export Dashboard Metrics to CSV:** You can now export the underlying time-series data from any dashboard panel directly to CSV format. This feature is invaluable for offline analysis, creating custom reports in Excel or other tools, meeting audit requirements, or building your own data visualizations. Perfect for network administrators who need to present performance data to stakeholders or maintain compliance records.
- **Intelligent Report Organization:** All newly generated SLA reports are now automatically organized into a hierarchical folder structure by year and month. This thoughtful organization dramatically improves navigation speed and makes filtering your report history significantly faster, especially valuable for organizations with extensive reporting requirements spanning multiple years.
- **Enhanced Developer APIs:** We've added new programmatic endpoints that allow you to list dashboards within specific folders and retrieve reports filtered by time period (year and month), enabling better integration with custom automation tools and external business intelligence systems.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Upgraded AI Co-pilot Intelligence:** The AI-powered troubleshooting assistant and script generation capabilities have been upgraded with a more advanced language model, delivering faster response times and significantly more accurate suggestions for network diagnostics, RouterOS configuration, and workflow automation tasks.
- **Dramatically Faster Report Management:** Browsing your historical SLA reports is now substantially faster, with performance improvements particularly noticeable for organizations managing hundreds or thousands of reports. Report generation and deletion operations are also more efficient and reliable, with enhanced error handling and progress tracking.
- **Optimized Dashboard Performance:** Dashboard visualizations now load more quickly and display more predictably across different time ranges. We've implemented intelligent query optimization that adapts based on the selected time window, ensuring responsive performance whether you're viewing hourly data or multi-month trends.
- **Enhanced WAN Failover Reliability:** Changes to WAN interface priority configurations are now processed more efficiently, resulting in faster and more predictable automatic failover behavior when internet connections fail. This improvement ensures business continuity for sites with multiple ISP connections managed by the SDX platform.
- **Improved CSV Data Quality:** CSV exports now include dynamically generated, human-readable column headers and ensure a daily "heartbeat" data point is included for each metric series, simplifying audit processes and making exported data easier to interpret.
- **Ongoing Platform Hardening:** We continue strengthening platform security and performance through systematic backend upgrades to core services, incorporating the latest security patches and performance optimizations from upstream dependencies.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Report Access Reliability:** Fixed an issue where download links for some historical reports could be incorrect after migration to the new hierarchical storage structure. Also resolved a display timing issue where report metadata wouldn't always appear immediately after generation completed.
- **Managed VPN Stability:** Addressed a route calculation edge case that could, under specific network topologies, cause instability for Managed VPN client connections. Enhanced validation now prevents this scenario.
- **Report Data Integrity:** Ensured that site metadata and tags used in SLA report calculations are always fetched from the authoritative source, preventing potential data inconsistencies when organizational structures change during report generation.
