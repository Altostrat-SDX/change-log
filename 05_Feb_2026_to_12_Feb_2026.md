This week, we're excited to introduce powerful new data export capabilities, significant performance enhancements for reporting, and a smarter AI experience. Read on to see what's new!

### ✨ New Features

*   **Export Dashboard Data to CSV:** You can now easily download the raw data from any dashboard panel directly to a CSV file. This is perfect for offline analysis, custom reporting, or auditing needs.
*   **Smarter Report Organization:** To make finding what you need faster, all newly generated reports are now automatically organized by year and month. This new structure significantly speeds up browsing and filtering your report history.
*   **New Developer APIs:** We've added new API endpoints that allow you to programmatically list dashboards within a specific folder and fetch reports by year and month.

### 🚀 Enhancements

*   **Faster, More Accurate AI:** Our AI-powered quick-response and code completion features have been upgraded with a more advanced language model, delivering faster and more accurate suggestions.
*   **Major Performance Boost for Reports:** Listing your historical reports is now dramatically faster, especially for accounts with a large number of reports. We've also made the report generation and deletion processes more efficient and reliable.
*   **Optimized Dashboard Graphing:** Graphs on your dashboards now load more quickly and display more consistently across different time ranges, thanks to smarter data query optimization.
*   **More Reliable Network Failover:** We've improved how changes to your WAN interface priorities are handled, resulting in faster and more predictable failover behavior.
*   **Improved CSV Exports:** The new CSV export feature now includes dynamic, easy-to-read column headers and ensures a daily 'heartbeat' data point is included for each series, making auditing simpler.
*   **Platform Security & Performance:** We're continuously improving platform security and performance with backend upgrades to our core services, incorporating the latest enhancements.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

*   **Reporting:** Fixed an issue where download links for some older reports could be incorrect after being moved to our new storage structure. We also resolved a display issue where report details wouldn't always appear immediately after generation.
*   **Network Stability:** Addressed a route calculation issue that could, in specific scenarios, cause instability for VPN clients.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensured that metadata used in reports is always fetched from the correct source, preventing potential data inconsistencies.
