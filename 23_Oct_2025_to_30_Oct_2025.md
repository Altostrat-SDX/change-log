This week focuses on improving operational efficiency with smarter onboarding capabilities, enhanced subscription management tools, and safer administrative workflows for managing your SDX platform at scale.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Intelligent Geolocation API:** Streamline workspace onboarding with a new API endpoint that automatically suggests appropriate currency and locale settings based on geographic location. This feature enables MSPs to create smoother onboarding experiences by pre-filling regional settings for new customer organizations, reducing manual configuration during setup.
- **Subscription Status Verification:** Programmatically verify whether an organization has an active subscription or is operating in trial mode through a new, straightforward API endpoint. This capability enables automated subscription management workflows and customer lifecycle automation.
- **Safe Usage Report Preview:** The administrative command-line tool now includes a `--list` option for site usage analysis. Review comprehensive reports of site counts and resource consumption across all organizations in your workspace hierarchy without applying any changes, supporting safe capacity planning and billing reconciliation.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Advanced Subscription Management:** Enhanced subscription APIs now support custom metadata attachment to subscriptions, enabling better integration with external CRM and billing systems. The invoice preview endpoint has been improved to handle different billing intervals (monthly, yearly) more accurately, providing better visibility into upcoming charges.
- **Subscription Protection Controls:** Subscriptions can now be marked as "read-only," preventing any modifications to critical managed or white-label accounts. This safeguard is particularly valuable for MSPs managing client subscriptions where changes should be controlled through your own billing workflows.
- **Auto-Recovery for Security Resources:** Enhanced resilience for Security Groups and Prefix Lists. The platform now automatically attempts to recover resources stuck in temporary error states, with clearer error messages to guide troubleshooting when manual intervention is required.
- **AI Usage Analytics Foundation:** Implemented foundational tracking infrastructure for AI Co-pilot feature usage. This behind-the-scenes work establishes the groundwork for future detailed usage analytics and insights, helping organizations understand and optimize AI-powered automation adoption.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **AI Conversation Stability:** Improved the reliability of AI Co-pilot conversations by implementing more robust error handling. This reduces the likelihood of conversations failing when the underlying language model API exhibits unexpected behavior, ensuring a more consistent experience when building workflows or generating RouterOS scripts.
