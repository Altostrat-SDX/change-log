We've been working hard this week to bring you several improvements and fixes across the platform to enhance your experience and ensure greater stability.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Web Access:** We've made it easier to get started by automatically directing users from the main web URL directly to the login page.
*   **Refined Search:** Streamlined a specific search function (ARP search) by removing a less relevant sorting option for clearer results.
*   **Increased Stability:** Enhanced the reliability of background tasks by allowing more execution time for longer operations.
*   **Visual Consistency:** Updated default colors in PDF headers and a specific template for a more consistent look and feel.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Enhanced Feature Reliability:** Resolved an issue that could occasionally prevent reliable operation of temporary access and port forwarding features under specific conditions.
*   **Improved Threat Filtering:** Corrected a problem where blocklist entries might not update correctly after initial failures, ensuring that active threats are consistently included in filtering.
