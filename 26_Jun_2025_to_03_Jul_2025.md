Hello! Here's a summary of the updates deployed this week (2025-06-26 to 2025-07-03) to enhance your experience:

### New Features

*   **Mock Load Shedding Status API:** A new capability is now available providing access to mock load shedding status information for sites that have recently experienced faults. This data is accessible via a new API endpoint for authenticated users with the required viewing permissions.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved Load Shedding Data Display:** The response data from the new mock load shedding status API now includes a helpful relative time field (such as "Starts in 12 hours" or "Ends in 3 hours"), making it much easier to quickly understand the mocked schedule.

We hope these updates improve your workflow!
