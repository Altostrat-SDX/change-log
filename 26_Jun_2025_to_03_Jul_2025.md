This week, we're excited to roll out a host of powerful updates designed to give you greater control, more flexibility, and a smoother experience across our platform. From advanced organizational tools to expanded billing options and critical performance fixes, here's what's new:

### New Features

*   **Flexible Hierarchical Organizations:** You can now create child organizations nested under existing ones, allowing for more precise management structures tailored to your business needs.
*   **Expanded Payment Options:** We've significantly increased the range of supported payment methods, now including US bank accounts, AU BECS Direct Debit, SEPA Direct Debit, PayPal, and Link, providing you with greater flexibility for managing your billing.
*   **Detailed Invoice Previews:** Get a clearer picture of your upcoming charges with our enhanced invoice preview, which now includes a comprehensive breakdown of individual line items, applicable taxes, and discounts.
*   **Resource Usage and Limits Visibility:** A new tool allows you to easily retrieve detailed information on your organization's resource consumption and configured limits, empowering you to monitor usage and plan capacity effectively.
*   **Simplified Trial Eligibility & Application:** Quickly check if your workspace qualifies for a 14-day free trial, which will now be automatically applied during the subscription creation process if eligible.
*   **Custom Organization Branding:** Personalize your organization by featuring a custom logo or picture, improving brand representation.
*   **Automated Billing Address Population:** Streamline the setup of new billing accounts as address fields will now automatically pre-fill based on the user's IP address when not explicitly provided.
*   **Strict Billing Account Hierarchy:** Enhanced validation ensures billing accounts are correctly assigned based on your setup, with child organizations consistently inheriting billing from their ancestors, simplifying financial management.
*   **Simulated Power Status (for Developers):** A new API endpoint is available for developers to test and build features related to power availability, providing simulated power status updates for active sites.

### Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Consistent API Responses and Pagination:** Developers will now experience a more predictable integration, with all API responses uniformly returning data in JSON format and standardized pagination across all list-based endpoints, making it easier to handle large datasets.
*   **Safer Payment Method Management:** To prevent service disruptions, you can no longer accidentally delete the only payment method associated with a billing account, ensuring continuous service.
*   **Stronger Authorization and Access Control:** All organization-related operations now feature enhanced security checks, rigorously validating permissions and ensuring data integrity.
*   **Streamlined Subscription Management:** We've improved error messages for subscription creation/updates and refined the update logic to intelligently manage subscription items, ensuring a smoother billing experience. All subscription-related API endpoints also include comprehensive validation.
*   **Robust Workspace Member Management:** Prevent accidental loss of administrative control as workspace owners can no longer demote or remove themselves if they are the sole owner. We've also added validation to prevent adding existing members and ensured user IDs are validated against our identity provider.
*   **Simplified Organization Naming:** The organization data model has been streamlined by using the `name` field as the primary user-facing identifier, simplifying management.
*   **Refined Billing Account Operations:** The process for creating and updating billing accounts has been improved to correctly handle optional fields, preventing unintended data overwrites.
*   **Optimized Payment Method Retrieval:** Fetching payment methods is now faster and more efficient, querying only the supported payment method types.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Accurate Subscription Billing:** Our system now correctly includes subscriptions in 'trialing' and 'past_due' statuses when calculating total quantities, ensuring more accurate billing and limit enforcement.
*   **Consistent Invoice Data Types:** Resolved issues where the invoice endpoint returned mixed data types, ensuring consistent array-based responses for API clients.
*   **Correct Usage Limit Enforcement:** A critical fix ensures that adding resources now correctly respects all applicable limits—including overall subscription capacity, individual organizational limits, and hierarchical limits—preventing over-provisioning.
*   **Graceful Product Removal Error Handling:** Attempts to remove products from a subscription now provide a more informative error response (400 Bad Request) instead of a server error.
*   **Single Billing Account Enforcement:** Workspaces configured for 'single' billing mode are now correctly restricted to a single billing account, preventing the creation of additional accounts in this mode.
