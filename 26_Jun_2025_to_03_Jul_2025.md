This week empowers MSPs with advanced organizational tools, expands global payment flexibility, and enhances billing transparency—making it easier to manage complex multi-client environments.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Hierarchical Organization Management**: Create nested child organizations under parent structures—essential for MSPs managing multiple clients with distinct resource allocations, permissions, and billing configurations.
- **Global Payment Expansion**: Dramatically expanded payment method support:
  - US bank accounts (ACH)
  - AU BECS Direct Debit
  - SEPA Direct Debit (European markets)
  - PayPal
  - Link
    Critical for international MSPs and enterprises operating across multiple regions.
- **Detailed Invoice Previews**: Enhanced previews include comprehensive line-item breakdowns, applicable taxes, and discounts—enabling accurate budget forecasting and client billing reconciliation.
- **Resource Usage Visibility**: New API retrieves detailed organization resource consumption and configured limits—essential for capacity planning, quota management, and proactive license management.
- **Automated Trial Provisioning**: System automatically checks trial eligibility and applies 14-day free trials during subscription creation—streamlining onboarding for new customers.
- **Organization Branding**: Upload custom logos and profile pictures for organization identification—important for white-label MSP portals.
- **Smart Billing Address**: Billing account creation auto-populates address fields based on IP geolocation when not explicitly provided—reduces friction during signup.
- **Strict Billing Hierarchy**: Enhanced validation ensures child organizations correctly inherit billing from parent organizations—prevents configuration errors and billing inconsistencies.
- **Simulated Power Status API** (Developers): Test endpoint provides simulated power status for active sites—useful for building UPS monitoring and power management features.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Consistent API Standards**: Uniform JSON responses and standardized pagination across all list-based endpoints simplifies integration and large dataset handling.
- **Payment Method Protection**: Prevents accidental deletion of the only payment method on billing accounts—ensuring uninterrupted service.
- **Enhanced Authorization**: Strengthened security checks across all organization operations with rigorous permission validation and data integrity enforcement.
- **Refined Subscription Management**: Improved error messages for subscription operations, intelligent subscription item management, and comprehensive validation across all subscription endpoints.
- **Workspace Owner Protection**: Prevents sole workspace owners from demoting or removing themselves—prevents accidental administrative lockouts. Enhanced member validation against identity provider.
- **Simplified Organization Naming**: Streamlined data model uses `name` field as primary identifier—reducing complexity.
- **Optimized Billing Operations**: Improved handling of optional fields during billing account creation/updates prevents unintended overwrites.
- **Efficient Payment Retrieval**: Faster payment method queries limited to supported types only.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Subscription Billing Accuracy**: Fixed inclusion of 'trialing' and 'past_due' subscriptions in total quantity calculations
- **Invoice Data Consistency**: Resolved mixed data types in invoice endpoint responses—now consistently returns arrays
- **Resource Limit Enforcement**: Critical fix ensures resource additions respect all limits (subscription capacity, organizational limits, hierarchical limits)
- **Subscription Product Removal**: Product removal failures now return informative 400 errors instead of server errors
- **Single Billing Mode**: Workspaces in 'single' billing mode correctly restricted to one billing account
