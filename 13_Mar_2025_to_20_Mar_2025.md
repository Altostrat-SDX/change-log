This week enhances Captive Portal management, strengthens vulnerability tracking capabilities, and introduces stable addressing for WAN tunnels—delivering operational efficiency across guest access, security compliance, and network management.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Secure Coupon Distribution**: Generate unique shareable links for valid Captive Portal coupons—simplifies guest credential distribution without requiring API access. Perfect for hotel front desks and conference organizers.
- **Device-Level Vulnerability Status**: Mark vulnerabilities as Accepted or Mitigated per MikroTik device—track remediation progress across your fleet. Essential for audit trails and compliance reporting.
- **AI Vulnerability Remediation**: Retrieve AI-powered mitigation guidance for specific vulnerabilities—accelerates security response with actionable remediation steps.
- **Vulnerability Severity Filtering**: Filter device vulnerabilities by CVSS score threshold—focus on critical and high-severity issues first.
- **Compliance Standards Mapping**: Vulnerability details now include relevant compliance frameworks (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, ISO-27001, NIST)—streamlines compliance assessment and reporting.
- **Dynamic DNS for WAN Tunnels**: Each Managed VPN tunnel receives a unique dynamic hostname that automatically updates with public IP changes—provides stable addressing for remote access despite dynamic IPs.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Reliable Report Notifications**: Enhanced notification delivery persists even when groups change—ensures stakeholders receive scheduled SLA reports consistently.
- **Coupon Schedule Tracking**: Manually triggered coupon generation now logs execution time for better audit trails.
- **Clearer API Responses**: Coupon validity displays in human-readable format ("X days and Y hours"), vulnerability lists grouped by CVE ID for clarity.
- **Standardized Timestamps**: Consistent ISO 8601 date/time formatting across APIs simplifies integration.
- **Streamlined Responses**: Removed redundant host data from vulnerability API responses while retaining essential details.
- **Performance Improvements**: Increased internal system limits boost responsiveness.
