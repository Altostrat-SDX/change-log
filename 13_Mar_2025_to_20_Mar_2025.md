This week, we've rolled out a series of updates bringing new features, performance enhancements, and reliability improvements across the platform to enhance your experience.

### New Features

*   Introduced a secure way to access valid coupons via a unique link, simplifying distribution without needing full API access.
*   Added the ability to mark vulnerabilities with a status (Accepted, Mitigated) on specific devices for better tracking of remediation progress.
*   You can now retrieve AI-powered suggestions for mitigating specific vulnerabilities.
*   Added filtering options when viewing vulnerabilities for a device, allowing you to focus on those exceeding a certain severity score.
*   Vulnerability details now include relevant compliance standards (like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2, ISO-27001, NIST) to help assess impact and reporting requirements.
*   Each network tunnel now has a unique dynamic hostname that automatically updates with its public IP, providing a stable address for access.

### Enhancements

*   Enhanced the reliability of report notifications, ensuring delivery even if notification groups change.
*   Manually triggered coupon schedules now correctly log their last run time for better tracking.
*   Improved clarity in API responses regarding coupon validity durations, showing details like "days and hours".
*   Vulnerability lists for devices are now grouped by the unique vulnerability identifier for a clearer overview.
*   Standardized date and time formats in API responses for improved consistency and ease of use.
*   Streamlined API responses by removing redundant top-level host lists, while keeping relevant details within the vulnerability entries.
*   Increased internal system limits to improve responsiveness and performance.

### Bug Fixes

*   Fixed an issue where expired coupons were sometimes incorrectly included in lists; now only valid ones are shown.
