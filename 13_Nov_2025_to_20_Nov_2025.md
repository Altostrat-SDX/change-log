This week delivers substantial performance enhancements across the SDX platform, with dashboard and reporting operations running significantly faster. Combined with intelligent automation for site configuration and strengthened security controls, these updates improve your daily network management experience.

### 🎉 New Features

- **Programmatic Metrics Access:** We've introduced secure internal APIs for querying time-series metrics and listing dashboards, laying the foundation for advanced automation capabilities and future integrations that extend the platform's monitoring and analytics capabilities.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Dramatically Faster Dashboard Loading:** Your network monitoring dashboards now load substantially faster with our re-engineered data fetching architecture. All dashboard panels now load in parallel rather than sequentially, delivering a much more responsive experience when monitoring your distributed MikroTik fleet.
- **Accelerated SLA Report Generation:** Generating SLA reports that include WAN performance metrics is now considerably faster and more reliable. We've optimized the underlying metric collection and aggregation processes to deliver network performance insights more quickly.
- **More Responsive Vulnerability Scanning:** Interactions with the vulnerability scanning system are now noticeably faster. We've implemented intelligent caching for RouterOS vulnerability data, significantly improving API response times when viewing scan results or scheduling new scans.
- **Automatic Site Geolocation:** To streamline site configuration, the platform now automatically attempts to determine geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) and timezone for newly created sites using their public IP address. This saves time during site onboarding and enables location-based features immediately.
- **Standardized WAN Traffic Units:** All WAN performance metrics (upload and download speeds) displayed in SLA reports are now consistently shown in Megabits per second (Mbps) for improved readability and easier comparison across sites.
- **Unified Metric Queries:** When querying performance metrics via the API, the system now automatically searches across all available data sources (site metrics, WAN performance, custom metrics) to provide complete, unified results without requiring multiple queries.
- **Extended Scan Control Validity:** Control links for managing running vulnerability scans now remain valid for six hours (increased from one hour), making it easier to manage long-running scans across large MikroTik fleets.

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes

- **Vulnerability Scan Permission Enforcement:** Fixed a security issue where vulnerability scan schedule details could potentially display sites outside a user's authorized scope. Scan schedules now correctly respect organizational permissions and role-based access controls.
- **WAN Metrics in Reports:** Resolved an issue that could prevent WAN performance metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss) from appearing in SLA reports, ensuring you always have complete visibility into connection quality across your network.
