This week, we've rolled out a series of powerful updates focused on boosting performance, improving usability, and strengthening security across the platform. Enjoy significantly faster dashboards and reports, more intuitive data, and a more reliable experience overall.

### ✨ New Features

*   **Programmatic Access to Metrics:** We've introduced a new set of internal APIs for securely querying metric data and listing dashboards. This provides a powerful new way for services to interact with your data, paving the way for future integrations and automation.

### 🚀 Enhancements & Improvements

*   **Massively Faster Dashboards:** Your monitoring dashboards now load significantly faster! We've re-engineered how data is fetched, allowing all panels on a dashboard to load in parallel for a much quicker and smoother experience.
*   **Speedier Report Generation:** Generating reports with WAN data is now substantially faster and more reliable. We've optimized the underlying metric collection process to deliver your insights more quickly.
*   **More Responsive Vulnerability Scans:** Interacting with the vulnerability scanner is now quicker, as we've implemented caching for external vulnerability data to improve API response times.
*   **Automatic Site Geolocation:** To save you time, we now automatically attempt to geolocate new sites (including latitude, longitude, and timezone) using their public IP address if a location hasn't been manually set.
*   **Clearer WAN Traffic Metrics:** To improve readability, all WAN traffic metrics (upload/download speeds) shown in reports are now displayed in Megabits per second (Mbps).
*   **More Comprehensive Metric Queries:** When you query for metrics, the system now automatically searches across all available data sources to provide a complete, unified result.
*   **Improved Scan Management:** We've extended the validity period for links used to stop a running vulnerability scan from one hour to six, making it easier to manage long-running tasks.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   **Security:** We fixed a permissions issue in the vulnerability scanner where the details for a scan schedule could, in some cases, display sites that the user was not authorized to see. Access is now correctly restricted based on user permissions.
*   **Reporting:** We resolved an issue that could prevent WAN performance metrics (like latency, jitter, and packet loss) from appearing in reports, ensuring you always have a complete view of your network health.
