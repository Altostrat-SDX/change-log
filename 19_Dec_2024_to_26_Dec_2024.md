### Weekly Summary (Dec 19 - Dec 26)

While there were no new major user-facing features deployed across the platform this week, our teams were focused on significant foundational work, particularly in enhancing our scripting and static IP management services.

**Service Development Focus:**

*   **Advanced Scripting (`scripts` service):**
    *   Initial development for AI-powered script generation and summarization (leveraging the `ai-llm` service) has commenced, with internal prototypes being tested.
*   **Elastic IP Management (`elastic-ip` service):**
    *   Refinements were made to the RADIUS integration, improving the reliability of credential synchronization and management for assigned static IPs.
    *   Enhanced logging and error handling for RADIUS database interactions were implemented.
*   **Platform Stability:** Ongoing infrastructure maintenance and stability improvements continued across all services.

Stay tuned for updates in the coming weeks as these underlying enhancements pave the way for new features!
