This week streamlines data management with intelligent cleanup workflows, accelerates reporting capabilities, and adds protective rate limiting for security operations.

### ✨ Enhancements

- **Intelligent Data Lifecycle Management**: Comprehensive cascading cleanup ensures data consistency:
  - **User Deletion**: Automatically removes user from notification groups and Managed VPN configurations—prevents orphaned access and notification failures
  - **Site Deletion**: Triggers cleanup across multiple services including Captive Portal configurations, security scan schedules, and device configurations—maintains data integrity across the platform
    Essential for compliance with data retention policies and preventing configuration drift.
- **Accelerated SLA Report Generation**: Optimized processing delivers faster report creation with enhanced reliability for large multi-site reports—critical for MSPs with monthly client reporting obligations.
- **Reliable Data Collection**: Improved background data collection ensures accurate site information. Enhanced subnet retrieval works reliably even with unstable connections—important for sites with intermittent connectivity.
- **Security Scan Rate Limiting**: Protective limits prevent resource exhaustion:
  - API-triggered scans limited to once per 24 hours per schedule
  - Minimum 2-week interval for recurring scheduled scans
    Prevents accidental excessive scanning and manages platform resource usage responsibly.
- **Updated PDF Branding**: Refreshed visual identity across generated reports, proposals, and webhook test messages.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Enhanced caching and improved handling of temporary network issues boost platform resilience.
