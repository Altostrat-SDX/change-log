### Platform Enhancements & Reliability Improvements

*   **Smoother Data Management:** We've made significant improvements to how data is cleaned up and synchronized across the platform. Deleting a user now automatically removes them from notification groups and associated VPN configurations. Deleting a site also triggers better cleanup in related services, including removing configurations from the captive portal service, associated security scan schedules, and device configurations, ensuring your data stays consistent and tidy.
*   **Faster Reporting:** Report generation is now quicker, with optimized processing and increased reliability for larger reports.
*   **Enhanced Data Collection:** Improved reliability and efficiency in background data collection processes means more accurate and dependable information about your sites. We also improved how site subnet information is retrieved, especially under less-than-ideal connection conditions.
*   **Security Scan Management:** To help manage resource usage and prevent accidental excessive use, we've added a rate limit for manually triggering security scan schedules via the API (once every 24 hours per schedule) and enforced a minimum interval of two weeks for recurring schedules.
*   **Updated Look & Feel:** Generated PDFs (like reports and proposals) and webhook test messages now feature updated branding.
*   **Behind-the-Scenes Performance:** We've implemented various internal performance improvements and system reliability enhancements, including better caching and handling of temporary network issues.

### Bug Fixes

*   Resolved an issue that could occasionally prevent the retrieval of site API credentials.
*   Corrected site incident logs displayed in PDF reports to show accurate downtime causes.
