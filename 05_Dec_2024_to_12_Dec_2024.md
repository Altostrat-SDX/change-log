### Highlights from December 5 - December 12

We've been busy enhancing your experience with new capabilities and improvements across our platform.

### New Features

*   **Aggregate WAN Ping Statistics API:** Introduced a new API endpoint allowing you to retrieve aggregated ping statistics across multiple WAN tunnels, providing a consolidated view of network performance.

### Enhancements

*   **Improved WAN Tunnel Graphing:** The individual WAN tunnel ping statistics graphs now better visualize data collection gaps, representing periods with missing data exceeding 5 minutes as 100% packet loss for clearer insights into connectivity.
*   **Updated Device Configuration References:** Branding and associated URLs referenced within device configuration scripts and logs have been updated for consistency across the platform.

This week also included important behind-the-scenes maintenance and infrastructure updates to ensure continued stability and performance.
