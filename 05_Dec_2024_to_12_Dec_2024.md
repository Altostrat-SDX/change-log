title: "Weekly Updates: WAN Monitoring APIs, Improved Graphing & Configuration Enhancements (Dec 5-12)"
description: "This week's updates bring a new API for aggregated WAN ping statistics, clearer data gap visualization in monitoring graphs, and refreshed UI in device configurations. Initial features for BGP/DNS log processing in `metrics` are also live."

### Highlights from December 5 - December 12

We've been busy enhancing your experience with new capabilities and improvements across our platform, particularly focusing on network monitoring and device management.

### New Features

*   **Aggregate WAN Ping Statistics API (within `metrics` service):** Introduced a new API endpoint allowing you to retrieve aggregated ping statistics (latency, packet loss, jitter) across multiple WAN tunnels (`wan-failover` service tunnels), providing a consolidated view of network performance.
*   **Initial BGP/DNS Log Processing (within `metrics` service):** The `metrics` service now includes foundational capabilities to ingest and process BGP and DNS logs from syslog feeds. This enables the generation of basic BGP traffic reports (top sources, ports, blocklist hits) and DNS query reports (top apps, categories, sources).

### Enhancements

*   **Improved WAN Tunnel Graphing (frontend consuming `metrics` data):** The individual WAN tunnel ping statistics graphs now better visualize data collection gaps, representing periods with missing data exceeding 5 minutes as 100% packet loss for clearer insights into connectivity.
*   **Updated Device Configuration References (by `mikrotik` and `control-plane`):** UI and associated URLs referenced within device configuration scripts (e.g., bootstrap, scheduler scripts) and logs generated by managed devices have been updated for consistency across the platform.

This week also included important behind-the-scenes maintenance and infrastructure updates to ensure continued stability and performance, especially for the `wan-failover` and `metrics` services as they handle more data.
