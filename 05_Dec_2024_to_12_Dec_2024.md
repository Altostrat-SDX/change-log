### 🎉 New Features

- **WAN Statistics API**: New API endpoint for aggregated ping statistics (latency, packet loss, jitter) across multiple WAN tunnels—providing consolidated network performance views
- **BGP & DNS Analytics**: Initial log processing capabilities enabling BGP traffic reports (top sources, ports, threat blocklist hits) and DNS query reports (top applications, categories, sources)

### ✨ Enhancements

- **WAN Monitoring Graphs**: Enhanced visualization of data collection gaps—periods with missing data exceeding 5 minutes now display as 100% packet loss for clearer connectivity insights
- **Device Configuration**: Updated URLs and references within device bootstrap and scheduler scripts for platform consistency
- **Infrastructure**: Behind-the-scenes maintenance and updates ensuring continued stability and performance as WAN Failover and metrics services scale
